      "And you will positively marry her, if she will have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a doubt of either. Before this day fortnight she shall be Madame Van
      Haubitz."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will make her your wife without acquainting her with your true
      position?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed will I. My very position requires it. There's no room for a
      scruple. She expects to live on my fortune; thinks to make a great catch
      of the rich Dutchman. Instead of that I shall spend her salary. The old
      story; going out for wool and returning shorn."
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation of which this is the concluding fragment, occurred in the
      public room of the Hotel de Hesse, in the village of Homburg on the Hill&mdash;then
      an insignificant handful of houses, officiating<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_2a" id="Page_2a">[Pg 2]</a></span> as capital of the important
      landgravate of Hesse-Homburg. The table-d'hôte had been over some time;
      the guests had departed to repose in their apartments until the hour of
      evening promenade should summon them to the excellent band of music,
      provided by the calculating liberality of the gaming-house keepers, and to
      loiter round the <i>brunnen</i> of more or less nauseous flavour, the
      pretext of resort to this rendezvous of idlers and gamblers. The waiters
      had disappeared to batten on the broken meats from the public table, and
      to doze away the time till the approach of supper renewed their activity.
      My interlocutor, with whom I was alone in the deserted apartment, was a
      man of about thirty years of age, whose dark hair and mustaches, marked
      features, spare person, and complexion bronzed by a tropical sun, entitled
      him to pass for a native of southern Europe, or even of some more ardent
      clime. Nevertheless he answered to the very Dutch patronymic of Van
      Haubitz, and was a native of Holland, in whose principal city his father
      was a banker of considerable wealth and financial influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was towards the close of a glorious August, and for two months I had
      been wandering in Rhine-land. Not after the fashion of deluded Cockneys,
      who fancy they have seen the Rhine when they have careered from Cologne to
      Mannheim astride of a steam-engine, gaping at objects<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_3a" id="Page_3a">[Pg 3]</a></span> passed as soon as perceived;
      drinking and paying for indifferent vinegar as Steinberger-Cabinet, eating
      vile dinners on the decks of steamers, and excellent ones in the capital
      hotels which British cash and patronage have raised upon the banks of the
      most renowned of German streams. On the contrary, I had early dispensed
      with the aid of steam, to wander on foot, with the occasional assistance
      of a lazy country diligence or rickety <i>einspänner</i>, through the many
      beautiful districts that lie upon either bank of the river;
      pedestrianising in Rhenish Bavaria, losing myself in the Odenwald, and
      pausing, when occasion offered, to pick a trout out of the numerous
      streamlets that dash and meander through dell and ravine, on their way to
      swell the waters of old Father Rhine. At last, weary of solitude&mdash;scarcely
      broken by an occasional gossip with a heavy German boor, village priest,
      or strolling student&mdash;I thirsted after the haunts of civilisation,
      and found myself, within a day of the appearance of the symptom, installed
      in a luxurious hotel in the free city of Frankfort on the Maine. But
      Frankfort at that season is deserted, save by passing tourists, who escape
      as fast as possible from its lifeless streets and sun-baked pavements; so,
      after glancing over an English newspaper at the Casino, taking one stroll
      in the beautiful garden surrounding the city, and another through the
      Jew-quarter&mdash;always interesting and<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_4a" id="Page_4a">[Pg 4]</a></span> curious, although anything
      but savoury at that warm season&mdash;I gathered together my baggage and
      was off to Homburg. There I could not complain of solitude, of deserted
      streets and shuttered windows. It seemed impossible that the multitude of
      gaily dressed belles and cavaliers, English, French, German, and Russ,
      who, from six in the morning until sunset, lounged and flirted on the
      walks, watered themselves at the fountains, and perilled their complexions
      in the golden sunbeams, could ever bestow themselves in the two or three
      middling hotels and few score shabby lodging-houses composing the town of
      Homburg. Manage it they did, however; crept into their narrow cells at
      night, to emerge next morning, like butterflies from the chrysalis, gay,
      bright, and brilliant, and to recommence the never-varying but pleasant
      round of eating, sauntering, love-making, and gambling. Homburg was not
      then what it has since become. That great house of cards, the new Cursaal,
      had not yet arisen; and its table-d'hôte, reading-room, and profane
      mysteries of roulette and rouge-et-noir, found temporary domicile in a
      narrow, disreputable-looking den in the main street, where accommodation
      of all kinds, but especially for dinner, was scanty in the extreme. The
      public tables at the hotels were consequently thronged, and there
      acquaintances were soon made. The day of my arrival at Homburg I was
      seated next to Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5a" id="Page_5a">[Pg
      5]</a></span> Haubitz; his manner was off-hand and frank; we entered into
      conversation, took our after-dinner cigar and evening stroll together, and
      by bed-time had knocked up that sort of intimacy easily contracted at a
      watering-place, which lasts one's time of residence, and is extinguished
      and forgotten on departure. Van Haubitz, like many Continentals and very
      few Englishmen, was one of those free-and-easy communicative persons who
      are as familiar after twelve hours' acquaintance as if they had known you
      twelve years, and who do not hesitate to confide to a three days'
      acquaintance the history of their lives, their pursuits, position, and
      prospects. I was soon made acquainted, to a very considerable extent, at
      least, with those of my friend Van Haubitz, late lieutenant of artillery
      in the service of his majesty the King of Holland. He was the youngest of
      four sons, and having shown, at a very early age, a wild and intractable
      disposition and precocious addiction to dissipation, his father pronounced
      him unsuited to business, and decided on placing him in the army. To this
      the <i>Junker</i> (he claimed nobility, and displayed above his arms a
      species of coronet, bearing considerable resemblance to a fragment of
      chevaux-de-frise, which he might have been puzzled to prop with a
      parchment) had no particular objection, and might have made a good enough
      officer, but for his reckless, spendthrift manner of life, which entailed
      negligence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6a" id="Page_6a">[Pg 6]</a></span>
      duty and frequent reprimands. Extravagant beyond measure, unable to deny
      himself any gratification, squandering money as though millions were at
      his command, he was constantly overwhelmed with debts and a martyr to
      duns. At last his father, after thrice clearing him with his creditors,
      consented to do so a fourth time only on condition of his getting
      transferred to a regiment stationed in the Dutch East Indies, and
      remaining there until his return had the paternal sanction. To avoid a
      prison, and perhaps not altogether sorry to leave a country where his cash
      and credit were alike exhausted, he embarked for Batavia. But any pleasant
      day-dreams he may have cherished of tropical luxuries, of the indulgence
      of a <i>farniente</i> life in a grass hammock, gently balanced by Javan
      houris beneath banana shades, of spice-laden breezes and cool sherbets,
      and other attributes of a Mohammedan paradise, were speedily dissipated by
      the odious realities of filth and vermin, marsh-fever and mosquitoes. He
      wrote to his father, describing the horrors of the place, and begging to
      be released from his pledge and allowed to return to Holland. His obdurate
      progenitor replied by a letter of reproach, and swore that if he left
      Batavia he might live on his pay, and never expect a stiver from the
      paternal strong-box, either as gift or bequest. To live upon his pay would
      have been no easy matter, even for a more prudent person than Van Haubitz.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7a" id="Page_7a">[Pg 7]</a></span> He
      grumbled immoderately, swore like a pagan, but remained where he was. A
      year passed and he could hold out no longer. Disregarding the paternal
      displeasure, and reckless of consequences, he applied to the chief
      military authority of the colony for leave of absence. He was asked his
      plea, and alleged ill health. The general thought he looked pretty well,
      and requested the sight of a medical certificate of his invalid state. Van
      Haubitz assumed a doleful countenance and betook him to the surgeons. They
      agreed with the general that his aspect was healthy: asked for symptoms;
      could discover none more alarming than regularity of pulse, sleep,
      appetite, and digestion, laughed in his face and refused the certificate.
      The sickly gunner, who had the constitution of a rhinoceros, and had never
      had a day's illness since he got over the measles at the age of four
      years, waited a little, and tried the second "dodge," usually resorted to
      in such cases. "Urgent private affairs" were now the pretext. The general
      expressed his regret that urgent public affairs rendered it impossible for
      him to dispense with the valuable services of Lieutenant Van Haubitz.
      Whereupon Lieutenant Van Haubitz passed half an hour in heaping
      maledictions on the head of his disobliging commander, and then sat down
      and wrote an application for an exchange to the authorities in Holland.
      The reply was equally unsatisfactory, the fact being that Haubitz senior,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8a" id="Page_8a">[Pg 8]</a></span> like an
      implacable old savage as he was, had made interest at the war-office for
      the refusal of all such requests on the part of his scapegrace offspring.
      Haubitz junior took patience for another year, and then, in a moment of
      extreme disgust and ennui, threw up his commission and returned to Europe,
      trusting, he told me, that after five years' absence, the governor's
      bowels would yearn towards his youngest-born. In this he was entirely
      mistaken; he greatly underrated the toughness of paternal viscera. Far
      from killing the fatted calf on the prodigal's return, the incensed old
      Hollander refused him the smallest cutlet, and, shutting the door in his
      face, consigned him, with more energy than affection, to the custody of
      the evil one. Van Haubitz found himself in an awkward fix. Credit was
      dead, none of his relatives would notice or assist him; his whole fortune
      consisted of a dozen gold Wilhelms. At this critical moment an eccentric
      maiden aunt, to whom, a year or two previously, he had sent a propitiatory
      offering of a ring-tailed monkey and a leash of pea-green parrots, and who
      had never condescended to acknowledge the present, departed this life,
      bequeathing him ten thousand florins as a return for the addition to her
      menagerie. A man of common prudence, and who had seen himself so near
      destitution, would have endeavoured to employ this sum, moderate as it
      was, in some trade or business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9a"
      id="Page_9a">[Pg 9]</a></span> or, at any rate, would have lived sparingly
      till he found other resources. But Haubitz had not yet sown all his
      wild-oats; he had a soul above barter, a glorious disregard of the future,
      the present being provided for. He left Holland, shaking the dust from his
      boots, dashed across Belgium, and was soon plunged in the gaieties of a
      Paris carnival. Breakfasts at the Rocher, dinners at the Café, balls at
      the opera, and the concomitant <i>petits soupers</i> and écarté parties
      with the fair denizens of the Quartier Lorette, soon operated a prodigious
      chasm in the monkey-money, as Van Haubitz irreverently styled his
      venerable aunt's bequest. Spring having arrived, he beat a retreat from
      Paris, and established himself at Homburg, where he was quietly completing
      the consumption of the ten thousand florins, at rather a slower pace than
      he would have done at that headquarters of pleasant iniquity, the capital
      of France. From hints he let fall, I suspected a short time would suffice
      to see the last of the legacy. On this head, however, he had been less
      confidential than on most other matters, and certainly his manner of
      living would have led no one to suppose he was low in the locker. Nothing
      was too good for him; he drank the best of wines, got up parties and
      pic-nics for the ladies, and had a special addiction to the purchase of
      costly trinkets, which he generally gave away before they had been a day
      in his possession. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10a"
      id="Page_10a">[Pg 10]</a></span> gamble; he had done so, he told me, once
      since he was at Homburg, and had won, but he had no faith in his luck, or
      taste for that kind of excitement, and should play no more. He was playing
      another game just now, which apparently interested him greatly. A few days
      before myself, a young actress, who, within a very short time, had
      acquired considerable celebrity, had arrived at Homburg, escorted by her
      mother. Fraülein Emilie Sendel was a lively lady of four-and-twenty or
      thereabouts, possessing a smart figure and pretty face, the latter
      somewhat wanting in refinement. Her blue eyes, although rather too
      prominent, had a merry sparkle; her cheeks had not yet been entirely
      despoiled by envious rouge of their natural healthful tinge; her hair, of
      that peculiar tint of red auburn which the French call a <i>blonde hasardé</i>,
      was more remarkable for abundance and flexibility than for fineness of
      texture. As regarded her qualities and accomplishments, she was
      good-humoured and tolerably unaffected, but wilful and capricious as a
      spoiled child; she spoke her own language pretty well, with an occasional
      slight vulgarism or bit of greenroom slang; had a smattering of French,
      and played the piano sufficiently to accompany the ballads and vaudeville
      airs which she sang with spirit and considerable freedom of style. I had
      met German actresses who were far more lady-like off the stage, but there
      was nothing glaringly or repulsively<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_11a" id="Page_11a">[Pg 11]</a></span> vulgar about Emilie, and
      as a neighbour at a public dinner-table, she was amusing and quite above
      par. As if to vindicate her nationality, she would occasionally look
      sentimental; but the mood sat ill upon her, and never lasted long: comedy
      was evidently her natural line. Against her reputation, rumour, always an
      inquisitive censor, often a mean libeller, of ladies of her profession,
      had as yet, so far as I could learn, found nothing to allege. Her mother,
      a dingy old dowager, with bad teeth, dowdy gowns, a profusion of
      artificial flowers, and a strong addiction to tea and knitting, perfectly
      understood the duties of duennaship, and did propriety by her daughter's
      side at dinner-table and promenade. To the heart of the daughter, Van
      Haubitz, almost from the first hour he had seen her, had laid persevering
      and determined siege.
    </p>
    <p>
      During our after-dinner tête-à-tête on the day now referred to, my friend
      the gunner had shown himself exceedingly unreserved, and, without any
      attempt on my part to draw him out, he had elucidated, with a frankness
      that must have satisfied the most inquisitive, whatever small points of
      his recent history and present position he had previously left in
      obscurity. The conversation began, so soon as the cloth was removed and
      the guests had departed, by a jesting allusion on my part to his
      flirtation with the actress, and to her gracious reception of his
      attentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12a" id="Page_12a">[Pg 12]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no mere flirtation," said Van, gravely. "My intentions are serious.
      You may depend Mademoiselle Sendel understands them as such."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serious! you don't mean that you want to marry her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unquestionably I do. It is my only chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your only chance!" I repeated, considerably puzzled. "Are you about to
      turn actor, and do you trust to her for instruction in histrionics?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly. I will explain. La Sendel, you must know, has just
      terminated her last engagement, which was at a salary of ten thousand
      florins. She has already received and accepted an offer of a new one, at
      fifteen thousand, from the Vienna theatre. Vienna is a very pleasant
      place. Fifteen thousand florins are thirty-two thousand francs, or twelve
      hundred of your English pounds sterling. Upon that sum two persons can
      live excellently well&mdash;in Germany at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to contradict any of these assertions, I held my tongue. The
      Dutchman resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know the history of my past life; I will tell you my present
      position. It is critical enough, but I shall improve it, for here," and he
      touched his forehead, "is what never fails me. This letter," (he produced
      an epistle of mercantile aspect, bearing the Amsterdam post-mark), "I
      received last week from my eldest brother. The shabby <i>schelm</i>
      declares he will reply to no more of mine, that his<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_13a" id="Page_13a">[Pg 13]</a></span> efforts to arrange
      matters with my father have been fruitless, and that the old gentleman has
      strictly forbidden him and his brothers to hold any communication with me,
      a command they seem willing enough to obey. So much for that. And now for
      the finances."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out his pocket-book, opened and shook it&mdash;a flimsy crumpled
      bit of paper fell out. It was a note of the bank of France, for one
      thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My last," said he. "That gone, I am a beggar. But it won't come to that,
      either, thanks to Fraülein Emilie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," said I, "you are too reckless of money, too extravagant and
      unreflecting. Six months ago, you told me you had twenty such notes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, twenty-two exactly, at the end of January, when I left Amsterdam. But
      whither was I bound? To Paris; and who can economise there? I've had my
      money's worth, and could have had no more, had I dribbled the dirty ten
      thousand florins over three years, instead of three months. I take great
      credit for making it last so long. Such suppers, and balls, and orgies,
      with the pleasantest fellows and prettiest actresses in Paris. But the
      louis-d'or roll rapidly in that sort of society. One must be a Russian
      prince, or a French <i>feuilletoniste</i>, to keep it up. I never flinched
      at anything so long as the money lasted. Then, when I found myself reduced
      to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14a" id="Page_14a">[Pg 14]</a></span>
      last note, I got into the Frankfort mail, and came to rusticate at this
      rural roulette-table. My next change will be to conjugation and Vienna."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if you had only a thousand francs on leaving Paris, and have got them
      still, how have you lived since?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't suppose these are the same? There are not many ways of getting
      through money here unless one gambles, which I do not; but coin has
      somehow or other a peculiar aptitude to slip through my fingers, and the
      thousand francs soon evaporated. Meanwhile, I had written dozens of
      letters to my brothers, who seldom answered, and to my father, who never
      did. I promised reform and a respectable life, if they would either get me
      a snug place with little to do and good pay, or make me a reasonable
      yearly allowance, something better than the paltry three thousand florins
      they doled out to me when I was in the artillery, and on which, as I could
      not live, I was obliged to get in debt. They paid no attention to my
      request, reasonable as it was. The best offer they made me was five francs
      a-day, paid weekly, to live in a Silesian village. This was adding insult
      to injury, and I left off writing to them. A few days afterwards, taking
      out my purse to pay for cigars, a dollar dropped out. It was my last. I
      paid it away, walked home, lay down upon my bed, smoked and reflected. My
      position was gloomy enough, and the more I looked<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_15a" id="Page_15a">[Pg 15]</a></span> at it, the blacker it
      seemed. From my undutiful relatives there was no hope; the abominable
      Silesian project was evidently their ultimatum. I had no friend to turn
      to, no resource left. I might certainly have obtained the mere necessaries
      of life at this hotel, where my credit was excellent, and have vegetated
      for a month or two, as a man must vegetate, without ready money. But I had
      no fancy for such an expedient, a mere protraction of the agony. I lay
      ruminating for two hours, two such hours as I should be sorry to pass
      again, and then my mind was made up. I had a brace of small
      travelling-pistols amongst my baggage; these I loaded and put in my
      pocket; and then, leaving the hotel and the town, I struck across the
      country for some distance and plunged into a wood. There I sat down upon a
      grass bank, my back against an old beech. It was evening, and the solitary
      little glade before me was striped with the last sunbeams darting between
      the tree-trunks. I have difficulty in defining my sensations at that
      moment. I was quite resolved, did not waver an instant in my purpose, but
      my head was dizzy, and I had a sickly sensation about the heart.
      Determined that the physical shrinking from death should not have time to
      weaken my moral determination, I hastily opened my waistcoat, felt for the
      pulsations of my heart, placed the muzzle of a pistol where they were
      strongest, steadying it on that spot with my left<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_16a" id="Page_16a">[Pg 16]</a></span> hand. Then I looked
      straight before me and pulled the trigger. There was the click of the
      lock, but no report; the cap was bad, and had been crushed without
      exploding. That was a horrible moment. I snatched up another pistol, which
      lay cocked to my hand, and thrust the muzzle into my mouth. As before, the
      sharp noise of the hammer upon the nipple was the sole result. The caps
      had been some time in my possession, and had become worthless through age
      or damp."
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Van Haubitz, doubtful whether he was not hoaxing me. But
      hitherto I had observed in him no addiction to the Munchausen vein, and
      now his countenance and voice were serious: there was a slight flush on
      his cheek, and he was evidently excited at the recollection of his
      abortive attempt at suicide,&mdash;perhaps a little ashamed of it. I was
      convinced he told the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," he continued, "whether, had I had surer weapons with me,
      I should have had courage to make a third attempt upon my life. Honestly,
      I think not; the self-preservative instinct was rapidly gaining strength.
      I walked slowly back to the town, my brain still confused from the
      agitating moments I had passed. I was unable quite to collect my thoughts,
      and felt as if I had just awakened from a long heavy sleep. It was now
      dark; lights streamed from the open windows of the gambling-rooms; the
      voices of the croupiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17a"
      id="Page_17a">[Pg 17]</a></span> the stir and hum of the players and
      jingling of money were distinctly heard in the street without. I have
      already told you I am no gambler, not from scruple, but choice.
      Nevertheless, I used often to stroll up to the Cursaal for an hour of an
      evening, when the play was at the highest, to look on and chat with chance
      acquaintances. Mechanically, I now ascended the stairs. On the
      landing-place, I found myself face to face with a man with whom I was
      slightly intimate, and who, a few evenings before, had borrowed forty
      francs of me. I had not seen him since, and he now returned me the piece
      of gold. 'Try your luck with it,' said he; 'there is a run against the
      bank to-night, everybody wins, and M. Blanc looks blue.' And he pointed to
      one of the proprietors of the tables, who, however, wore a tolerably
      tranquil air, knowing well that what was carried away one night, would
      come back with compound interest the next. The play was heavy at the
      rouge-et-noir table; a Russian and two Frenchmen&mdash;the latter of whom,
      judging from their appearance, and from the complicated array of
      calculations on the table before them, were professional gamblers&mdash;extracted,
      at nearly every <i>coup</i>, notes or rouleaus of gold from the grated
      boxes in front of the bankers. I drank a glass of water, for my lips were
      dry and hot, and, placing myself as near the table as the crowd of players
      and spectators permitted, watched the game.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_18a" id="Page_18a">[Pg 18]</a></span> My hand was in my pocket,
      the forty-franc piece still between its fingers. But in spite of the
      advice of him who had paid it me, I felt no disposition to risk the coin;
      not that I feared to lose it, for as my only one it was useless, but
      because, as I tell you, I never had the slightest love of gambling or
      expectation to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pause occurred in the game. The cards had run out, and the bankers were
      subjecting them to those complicated and ostentatious shufflings intended
      to convince the players of the fairness of their dealings. During this
      operation the previous silence was exchanged for eager gossip. The game,
      it appeared, had come out that night in a peculiar manner, very favourable
      to those who had had the address and nerve to avail themselves of it.
      There had been alternate long runs upon red and black.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'<i>Mille noms de Dieu!</i>' exclaimed a hoarse cracked voice just below
      me. 'What a series of black! Twenty-two, and only three red! And to be
      unable to take advantage of it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I looked down, and recognised the grey mustache, wrinkled features, and
      snuffy black coat with a ribbon of the Legion of Honour, of an old French
      colonel whom you may have seen limping in and out of the Cursaal, and who
      ranks amongst the antiquities of Homburg. He served under Napoleon, was
      shelved at the peace, and has lived since then on a moderate annuity, of
      which one-fifth procures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19a"
      id="Page_19a">[Pg 19]</a></span> him the barest necessaries of existence,
      whilst the other four parts are annually absorbed in the vortex of
      rouge-et-noir. When gambling-houses were legal at Paris, <i>le colonel
      rapé</i>, the threadbare colonel, as he was called, was one of the most
      punctual attendants at Frascati's and the Palais Royal. When they were
      abolished, he commenced a wandering existence amongst the German baths,
      and finally settled down at Homburg, giving it the preference, as the only
      place where he could follow his darling pursuit alike in winter and in
      summer. From the opening to the close of the play he is seen seated at the
      table, a number of cards, ruled in red and black columns, on the green
      cloth before him, in which he pricks with pins the progress of the game.
      That evening he had been unfortunate, and had emptied his pocket, but
      nevertheless continued puncturing cards with laudable perseverance, of
      course discovering, like every penniless gambler, that, had he money to
      stake, he should infallibly make a fortune; predicting what colour would
      come out, and indulging, when he proved a true prophet, in a little
      subdued blasphemy because he was unable to profit by his acuteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Extraordinary run! to be sure,' repeated the veteran dicer. 'Twenty-two
      black, and only three red! There'll be a series of red now; I feel there
      will, and when I don't play myself, I'm always right. I bet this deal
      begins with seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20a" id="Page_20a">[Pg
      20]</a></span> red. Who bets a hundred francs to fifty it does not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody accepted this sporting offer, or placed upon the colour which the
      colonel's prophetic soul foresaw was to come out. The cards were now
      shuffled and cut for dealing. The hell relapsed into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'<i>Faites le jeu, Messieurs!</i>' was repeated in the harsh
      business-like tones of the presiding demon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Red wins,' croaked the colonel. 'Seven times at the least.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly all the players backed the black. By an idle impulse I threw down
      my forty francs, my entire fortune, upon the red. The old soldier looked
      round to see the judicious individual who followed his advice, smiled
      grimly, and nodded approvingly. The next moment red won. I let the money
      lie, and walked into the next room. Eighty francs were of no more use to
      me than forty, and I felt very sure that another turn of the card would
      carry off both stake and winnings. I took up a newspaper, but soon threw
      it down again, for my head was not clear enough to read, and I felt
      exhausted with the emotions of the day. I was about to leave the house
      when I heard a loud buzz in the card-room, and the next instant somebody
      clutched my arm. It was the French colonel, in a state of furious
      excitement; grinning, panting, perspiring, and stuttering with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21a" id="Page_21a">[Pg 21]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Seven reds!' was all he could say. 'Seven reds, Monsieur. Take up your
      money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hastened to the table. By a strange caprice of fortune, the colonel's
      prophecy had come true. Red had won seven times, and my forty francs had
      become five thousand. I took up my winnings, the colonel looking on with a
      triumphant smile. This was suddenly exchanged for a portentous frown and
      fierce twist of the grey mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'<i>Mille millions de tonnerres!</i> Not a dollar left to follow up that
      splendid run!' And with a furious gesture, he upset his chair, and dashed
      his cards upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took the hint, whether intended or not. I could not do less in return
      for the five thousand francs the old gentleman had put in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If Monsieur,' I said, 'will allow me the pleasure of lending him&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'<i>Impossible, Monsieur!</i>' interrupted the colonel, looking as stern
      as if about to charge single-handed a whole pulk of Cossacks. But I knew
      my man. He was the type of a class of which I have seen many.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'<i>Cependant, Monsieur, entre militaires</i>, between brother-soldiers&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'<i>Ah! Monsieur est militaire!</i>' exclaimed the old gentleman, his
      alarming contraction of brow and rigidity of feature instantaneously
      dissolving into a smile of extreme benignity. 'That alters the case.
      Certainly, between brothers in arms those<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_22a" id="Page_22a">[Pg 22]</a></span> little services may be
      offered and accepted. Although, really, it is encroaching on Monsieur's
      complaisance ... at the same time ... a hundred francs ... till to-morrow
      ... quarters at some distance ... &amp;c. &amp;c.,' which ended in his
      picking up his chair, cards, and pin, and applying all his faculties to
      break the bank with ten <i>louis</i> which I lent him, and which I need
      hardly say I have not seen from that day to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a sudden stroke of good fortune would have made gamblers of nine men
      out of ten, but I decidedly want the organ of gaming, for I have never
      played since. My narrow escape from suicide had made some impression on
      me, and now that I had five thousand francs in my pocket, I looked back at
      the attempt as an exceedingly foolish proceeding. For a month or more, I
      lived with what even you would admit to be great economy, writing frequent
      letters to Amsterdam, and trying to come to terms and an arrangement with
      my family. All in vain. They had no confidence in my promises, proposed
      nothing I could accept, talked of Silesian exile&mdash;roots and water in
      the wilderness&mdash;and the like absurdities, until I plainly saw they
      were determined to cast me off, and that if I was to be helped at all, it
      must be by myself. How to do this was the puzzle. There are few things I
      can do, that could in any way be rendered profitable. I can ride a horse,
      lay a gun, and put a battery through<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_23a" id="Page_23a">[Pg 23]</a></span> its exercise; but such
      accomplishments are sufficiently common not to be paid at a very high
      rate; and besides, I had had enough of garrison duty, even could I have
      got back my commission, which was not likely. So I put soldiering out of
      the question; and yet, when I had done so, I was puzzled to think of
      anything better. I had no fancy to turn rook, and rove from place to place
      in search of pigeons&mdash;no uncommon resource with younger brothers of
      an idle turn and exhausted means. I had fallen in with a few birds of that
      breed, and had come to the conclusion that, to save themselves work and
      trouble, they had adopted by far the most laborious and painful of all
      professions. In the midst of my doubts and uncertainties, the fair Sendel
      and her mother made their appearance. The first sight of their names upon
      the hotel book was a ray of light to me. Within an hour I made up my mind
      to sacrifice my independence to my necessities, and become the virtuous
      and domesticated spouse of the charming and well-paid Emilie. A hint and a
      dollar to the waiter placed me next her at the table-d'hôte, and I
      immediately opened my intrenchments, and began a siege in due form."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which you expect will soon terminate by the capitulation of the
      garrison?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly. The result of the first day or two's operations was not very
      satisfactory. I rattled away, and did the amiable to a furious extent; but<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24a" id="Page_24a">[Pg 24]</a></span> the
      divinity was shy, and the guardian of the temple (an old gorgon whom I
      shall suppress before the honeymoon is out) looked askance at me, and
      pulled her daughter by the sleeve whenever she seemed disposed to listen.
      They evidently thought the rattle might belong to a snake; did me the
      injustice to take me for an adventurer. On the third day, however, the ice
      had melted. I soon found out the cause of the thaw. The head-waiter, whom
      a little well-timed liberality had rendered my devoted slave, informed me
      that Madame Sendel had been making minute inquiries concerning me of the
      master of the hotel. The worthy man, who adored me because I despised <i>vin
      ordinaire</i> and looked only at the sum-total of his bills, said that I
      was a son of Van Haubitz, the rich banker of Amsterdam, which was
      perfectly true; adding, which was rather less so, that I was a partner in
      the house, and a <i>millionaire</i>. The effect of this information upon
      the speculative firm of Sendel <i>Mère et Fille</i>, was perfectly
      electric. Medusa smoothed her horrid locks, and came out at that day's
      dinner in cherry ribbons and fresh artificials. Emilie was all smiles and
      suavity, laughed at my worst jokes, nearly burst her stays by holding her
      breath to raise a blush at my soft speeches, and returned from that
      evening's promenade talking about the moon, and leaning tenderly on my
      arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With such encouragement, I am surprised you did not propose at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25a" id="Page_25a">[Pg 25]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "So hasty a measure&mdash;oh, most unsophisticated of Britons!" replied
      Van, with a look of grave pity for my simplicity&mdash;"would have greatly
      perilled the success of my scheme. Sendel Senior, having only the
      innkeeper's report to rely on, would have had her ungenerous suspicions
      re-awakened by my precipitation, and have instituted further inquiries;
      have written, probably, to some friend in Holland, and learned that the
      pretender to her daughter's hand, although unquestionably a son of the
      wealthy banker Van Haubitz, is excluded beyond redemption from the good
      graces of that respectable pillar of Dutch finance, who has further
      announced his irrevocable determination to take not the slightest notice
      of him in his testamentary dispositions. The excellent Herr Bratenbengel,
      whose succulent dinner we are now digesting, and whose very laudable <i>Rudesheimer</i>
      stands before us, had unwittingly laid the foundation of my success; it
      was for me to raise the superstructure. Now it was that I rejoiced at my
      economy since the lucky hit at the gaming-table. The greater part of my
      winnings still remained to me; golden grain, which I profusely scattered,
      sure that it would yield rich harvest. I had already made a favourable
      impression, and this I took care to confirm by the liberal expenditure
      which you, in your ignorance, have called extravagance; by treating money
      as if its abundance in my coffers made it valueless in my eyes, and by
      delicate generosity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26a"
      id="Page_26a">[Pg 26]</a></span> the shape of presents to mother and
      daughter. The trap was too well set to prove a failure; the birds are
      fairly snared, and to-night, when we take our usual romantic stroll, I
      shall raise the fair Sendel to the seventh heaven of happiness by asking
      her to become Madame Van Haubitz."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the tenor and tone of these confessions by no means tended to
      elevate the Dutchman in my opinion, I could not but smile at the coolness
      with which they were made, and at the skill of his man&oelig;uvres. There
      was some good about the scamp; he had his own code of honour, such as it
      was, and from that he would not easily have been induced to swerve. He
      would have scorned to do a dirty thing, to cheat at cards, or leave a debt
      of honour unpaid; but would readily have got in debt to tradesmen and
      money-lenders beyond all possibility of reimbursement. And as regarded his
      present conspiracy against the celibacy and salary of Mademoiselle Sendel,
      a senate of sages and logicians would have failed to convince him of its
      impropriety. He looked upon it as a most justifiable stratagem, a lawful
      spoiling of the spoiler, praiseworthy in the sight of men, gods, and
      columns, and which he would perhaps have boasted of to a considerable
      extent to many besides myself, had not secresy been essential to the
      welfare of his combinations. I did not feel myself bound to betray his
      plot, or to put the Sendel on her guard against this snake amongst the
      roses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27a" id="Page_27a">[Pg 27]</a></span>
      And whilst mentally resolving rather to diminish than increase the
      intimacy which the confident and confidential artilleryman had in great
      measure forced upon me, and which I, through a sort of easy-going
      indolence of character, had perhaps somewhat lightly accepted, I
      anticipated diversion in watching the man&oelig;uvres of the high
      contracting parties. I considered myself as a spectator, called upon to
      witness an amusing comedy in real life, and admitted behind the scenes by
      peculiar favour of an actor. I resolved to watch the progress of the
      intrigue, and, if possible, to be present at the <i>dénouement</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quite certain," said I to Van, "that Mademoiselle Sendel's
      pecuniary position and prospects are so very favourable? The sum you
      mentioned is a large one for an actress who has been so short a time on
      the stage. Public report, very apt to take liberties with the reputation
      of theatrical ladies, often endeavours to compensate them by magnifying
      their salaries."
    </p>
    <p>
      Van, I may here mention, lest the reader should not have perceived it, had
      a most inordinate opinion of his own abilities and acuteness. Like certain
      Yankees, he "conceited" it was necessary to rise before the sun to outwit
      him, and even then your chance was a poor one. He had been in hot water
      all his life, never out of difficulties and scrapes&mdash;once, as has
      been shown, kept from suicide by a mere accident and was now reduced to
      the alternative of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28a" id="Page_28a">[Pg
      28]</a></span> beggary or of marrying for a living. None of these
      circumstances, which would have taken the conceit out of most men, at all
      impaired his opinion of his talent and sharpness. Replying to my
      observation merely by a slight shrug, and by a smile of pity for the man
      who thus misappreciated his foresight, he again produced his pocket-book,
      and extracted from its innermost recesses a fragment of a German
      newspaper, reputed oracular in matters theatrical. This he handed to me,
      tapping a particular paragraph significantly with his forefinger. The
      paragraph was thus conceived:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="blockquot">
      "<span class="smcap">THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.</span>&mdash;That promising
      young actress, Fraülein Emilie Sendel&mdash;whose first appearance, in the
      spring of last year, at once established her in the foremost line of the
      dramatic genius of the day&mdash;has concluded her twelve months'
      engagement at the <i>Hof Theater</i> of B&mdash;&mdash;, where she
      doubtless considered, and not without reason, that her talents and
      exertions were inadequately compensated by a salary of ten thousand
      florins. The gay society of that capital will sensibly feel the loss of
      the accomplished and fascinating comedian, who has accepted an engagement
      at Vienna, on the more suitable terms of fifteen thousand florins, with
      two months' <i>congé</i>, and other advantages. Before proceeding to
      ravish the eyes and ears of the pleasure-loving population of the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29a" id="Page_29a">[Pg 29]</a></span> <i>Kaiser-Stadt,
      la belle</i> Sendel is off to the baths, under the protecting wing of the
      watchful guardian who has presided at all her theatrical triumphs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clear enough, I think," said Van, when I raised my eyes from the
      protracted periods of the penny-a-liner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had nothing to say against the lucidity of the paragraph, nor anything
      to urge, at all likely to avail, against the prosecution of Van's designs
      upon the lady's hand and fifteen thousand florins, with "two months' <i>congé</i>
      and other advantages." No possible sophistry, to which I was equal, could
      prove the marriage to be against his interest; and as to trying him on the
      tack of delicacy&mdash;"imposition on an unprotected woman, degrading
      dependence on her exertions," and so forth&mdash;I knew the thick skin and
      indomitable self-conceit of the gunner would repel such feather-shafts
      without feeling them, or that the utmost effect I could expect to produce
      would be to get into a quarrel with the redoubtable native of the
      Netherlands, a predicament in which, as a man of peace, I was by no means
      anxious to find myself. So after hazarding the fruitless hint with which
      the reader was made acquainted at the commencement of this narrative, I
      abstained from all further intermeddling, and retired to my apartment,
      leaving Van Haubitz to con the declaration with which he was that evening<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30a" id="Page_30a">[Pg 30]</a></span> to
      rejoice the ears of the fair and too-confiding Sendel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed early that night, and saw nothing more of the Hollander till
      the next morning, when I was roused from a balmy slumber at the untimely
      hour of seven, by his bursting into my room with more impetuosity than
      ceremony, with the gestures of a maniac and the mien of a conqueror.
      Before my eyes were half open, he was more than half through the history
      of his proceedings on the previous evening. His success had been complete.
      Emilie had faltered, with downcast eyes, a sweet assent. The friendly
      gloom of eve, and the over-arching foliage, beneath whose shade the
      momentous question was put, saved her the necessity of practising upon her
      lungs to produce a blush. Mamma Sendel had bestowed her blessing upon the
      happy pair, and in the ardour of her maternal accolades had nearly
      extinguished her future son-in-law's left ogle with the wire stalk of an
      artificial passion-flower. The first burst of benevolence over, and the
      effervescence of feeling a little calmed, the bridegroom elect, who could
      not afford delays, pressed for an early day. Thereupon Emilie was, of
      course, horror-stricken, but her maternal relative, nothing loth to land
      the fish thus satisfactorily hooked, and well aware of the impediments
      that sometimes arise between cup and lip, ranged herself upon the side of
      the eager lover, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31a"
      id="Page_31a">[Pg 31]</a></span> combined forces bore down all opposition.
      Madame Sendel at first showed an evident hankering after a preliminary
      jaunt to Amsterdam and a gay wedding, graced by the presence of the
      bridegroom's numerous and wealthy family. She also testified some anxiety
      as to the view Van Haubitz Senior might take of his son's matrimonial
      project, and as to how far he might approve of a hasty and unceremonious
      wedding. But the gallant artilleryman had an answer to everything. He
      pledged himself, which he was perfectly safe in doing, that his father
      would not attempt in the slightest degree to control his inclinations or
      interfere with his projects, extolled the delights of an autumnal tour
      with his wife and mother-in-law before returning to Holland; in short, was
      so plausible in his arguments, so specious and pressing, pleaded so
      eloquently the violence of his love and inutility of delay, and overruled
      objections with such cogent reasoning, that he achieved a complete
      triumph, and it was agreed that in one week Van Haubitz should lead his
      adored Emilie to the hymeneal altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be a small matter to arrange with respect to Emilie," said
      Madame Sendel in her blandest tones, and with affectation of
      embarrassment. "She has an engagement at the Vienna theatre, which must of
      course now be broken off. There is a forfeit to pay, no very heavy sum,"
      added she&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32a" id="Page_32a">[Pg 32]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word about that," interrupted Van, whose blood curdled in his veins
      at the mere idea of cancelling the engagement on which his hopes were
      built. "There is no hurry for a few days. Let me once call Emilie mine,
      and I take charge of all those matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emilie smiled angelically; Madame patted her considerate son-in-law on the
      shoulder, and applied to her snuff-box to conceal her emotion; and all
      matters of business being thus satisfactorily settled, the evening closed
      in harmony and bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you for Frankfort to-day?" said Van Haubitz, when he had concluded
      his exulting narrative, and without giving me time for congratulations,
      which I should have been at a loss to offer. "I am off, after breakfast,
      to get some diamond earrings and other small matters for my adorable. I
      shall be glad of your taste and opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diamonds!" I exclaimed. "Farewell, then, to the thousand franc note&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh! Nonsense! You don't suppose I throw away my last cash that way. The
      Frankfort jewellers know me well, or think they do, which is the same
      thing. They have seen enough of my coin since I have been at Homburg. For
      them, as for my excellent mother-in-law, I am the wealthy partner in the
      undoubted good firm of Van Haubitz, Krummwinkel, &amp; Co. I never told
      them so; if they choose to imagine it I am not to blame. My<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33a" id="Page_33a">[Pg 33]</a></span> credit
      is good. The diamonds shall be paid for&mdash;if paid for they must be&mdash;out
      of Madame Van Haubitz's first quarter's salary."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was meditating an excuse for not accompanying my pertinacious and
      unscrupulous acquaintance on his cruise against the Frankfort Israelites,
      when he resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the by," he said, "you will come to church with us. I have arranged it
      all. Quite private, for reasons good. Nobody but yourself, Madame Sendel,
      and Emilie. You shall act as father, and give away the bride."
    </p>
    <p>
      The start I gave, at this alarming announcement, nearly broke the bed.
      This was carrying things rather too far. Not satisfied with rendering me,
      by his intrusive and unsolicited confidence, a sort of tacit accomplice in
      his man&oelig;uvres, this Dutch Gil Blas would fain make me an active
      participator. I drew at sight on my imagination, quickened by the peril,
      for a letter received the previous evening from a dear and near relative
      who lay dangerously ill at Baden-Baden, and to whose sick-bed it was
      absolutely necessary I should immediately repair; and, jumping up, I began
      to dress in all haste, rang furiously for the bill and a carriage, and
      requested Van Haubitz to present my excuses to the ladies, my unexpected
      departure at that early hour depriving me of the pleasure of taking leave
      of them. The Dutchman swore all manner of <i>donderwetters</i><span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34a" id="Page_34a">[Pg 34]</a></span> and <i>sacraments</i>
      that he was grieved at my departure, trusted I should find my friend
      better, and be able to return to Frankfort in time for the marriage, but
      did not press me to do so, and in reality was too exhilarated by the
      success of his machinations to care a straw about the matter. And saying
      he must go and write to Amsterdam, he shook me by the hand and left the
      room, whistling in loud and joyous key the burthen of a Dutch march. In
      less than an hour I was on the road to Frankfort, and that evening I
      reached Heidelberg, where some friends of mine had passed the summer. I
      expected to find them still there, but they had left for Baden-Baden.
      Thither I pursued them, and&mdash;as if it were a judgment on me for my
      white lie to the Dutchman&mdash;arrived there the morrow of their
      departure. Baden was thinning, and they had gone down stream: I must have
      passed them on the Rhine. Having strong reasons to see them before they
      left Germany, I followed upon their trail. But their movements were rapid
      and eccentric, and after tracking them to one or two of the minor baths,
      the chase led me back to Frankfort. Here I made sure to catch them, or
      resolved to give up the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week had been consumed in thus travelling to and fro. I had no great
      fancy for returning to Frankfort, lest my friend the Dutchman should still
      be there, and press his society upon me, of which,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_35a" id="Page_35a">[Pg 35]</a></span> after his recent
      revelations, I was anything but ambitious. Upon the whole, however, I
      thought it likely he would have departed. I knew he would accelerate his
      marriage as much as possible; I had been nine days absent, which gave him
      ample time to get over the ceremony and leave the neighbourhood. By way of
      precaution I resolved to keep pretty close in my hotel during the period
      of my stay, which was not to exceed one or two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the "White Swan," I found my friends were staying there,
      but had driven over to Homburg. Unwilling to follow them, and risk meeting
      my bugbear, I awaited their return, which was to take place to a late
      dinner. As usual, there was much bustle at the "Swan;" many goings and
      comings, several carriages in the courtyard, others in the street packing
      for departure, a throng of greedy <i>lohn-kutschers</i>, warm waiters, and
      bearded couriers hanging about the door, and running up and down stairs. I
      entered the public room. It was past noon, and the tables were laid for
      dinner, but there were only two persons in the apartment, a gentleman and
      a lady. They stood at a window, outside of which a handsome Vienna-made
      berline, with a count's coronet on the panels, was being got ready for a
      journey. As I walked up the room, the lady turned her head, and I was
      instantly struck by her resemblance to Emilie Sendel. So strong was it
      that I for a moment thought I had fallen in with<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_36a" id="Page_36a">[Pg 36]</a></span> the very persons I wished
      to avoid. A second glance convinced me of my error. The likeness was
      certainly startling, but there were many points of difference. Age and
      stature were the same, so were the hair and complexion, save that the
      former was less ruddy, the latter paler than in the case of the buxom
      Emilie. And there were grace and refinement about this person, far beyond
      any to which the Dutchman's lady-love could pretend. The expression of the
      interesting features was rather pensive than gay, and there was something
      classical in the arch of the eyebrow and outline of the face. The lady was
      plainly but richly attired in an elegant travelling-dress, and had her
      hand upon the arm of a tall and very handsome man, about forty years of
      age, of singularly aristocratic but somewhat dissipated appearance. They
      were talking as I entered, and a sentence or two of their conversation
      reached my ear. They spoke French, with a scarcely perceptible foreign
      accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious to know who these persons were, I returned to the court of the
      hotel, intending to question a waiter. It was first necessary to catch
      one, not easy at that busy time of day; and after several fruitless
      efforts to detain the jacketed gentry, I gave up the attempt, and took my
      station at the gateway. Scarcely had I done so, when a carriage drove up
      at a rattling pace, a small spit of a boy in a smart green suit, and with
      an ambiguous sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37a" id="Page_37a">[Pg
      37]</a></span> coronet embroidered in silver on the front of his cap,
      jumped off and opened the door, and there emerged from the vehicle, to my
      infinite dismay, the inevitable Van Haubitz. Retreat was impossible, for
      he saw me directly; and after handing out Madame Sendel and her daughter,
      seized me vehemently by both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delighted to see you!" he cried; "I wish you had been a day sooner. We
      were married yesterday," he added in a hurried voice, drawing me aside.
      "Have left Homburg, paid everything <i>there</i>, and leave this to-morrow
      for Heaven knows where. Explanations must come first (here he made a
      grimace), for my purse is low, and my mother-in-law makes projects that
      would ruin Rothschild. Lucky you are here to back me. Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was fairly caught, and in a pretty dilemma. My first thought was to
      knock down the Dutchman, and run for it, but reflection checked the
      impulse. Stammering a confused congratulation to the bride and her mother,
      and meditating an escape at all hazards, I allowed Madame Sendel to hook
      herself on my arm, and lead me into the hotel in the wake of the
      newly-wedded pair, who made at once for the public room. A magnificent
      courier, in a Hungarian dress, with beard, belt, and hunting-knife, strode
      past us into the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Herr Graf</i>," said the man, addressing the distinguished-looking
      stranger who had attracted my attention, "the horses are ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38a" id="Page_38a">[Pg 38]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count and his companion turned at the announcement, and found
      themselves face to face with our party. There was a general start and
      exclamation from the three women. The strange lady turned very pale and
      visibly trembled; Madame Van Haubitz gave a slight scream; her mother
      flushed as red as the poppies in her head-dress, and hung like a log upon
      my arm, glaring angrily at the strangers. For one moment all stood still;
      Van Haubitz and I looked at each other in bewilderment. He was evidently
      struck by the extraordinary resemblance I had noticed, and which became
      more manifest, now that the two ladies were seen together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Ameline," said the Count, who alone preserved complete
      self-possession. And he hurried his companion from the room. Madame Sendel
      released my arm, and letting herself fall upon a chair with an hysterical
      giggle, closed her eyes and seemed preparing for a comfortable swoon. Her
      daughter hastened to her assistance and untied her bonnet; Van Haubitz
      grasped a decanter of water and made an alarming demonstration of emptying
      it upon the full-moon countenance of his respectable mother-in-law. I was
      curious to see him do it, for I had always had my doubts whether the
      dowager's colours were what is technically termed "fast." My curiosity was
      not gratified. Whether from apprehension of the remedy or from some other
      cause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39a" id="Page_39a">[Pg 39]</a></span>
      I cannot say, but Madame Sendel abandoned her faint, and after two or
      three grotesque contortions of countenance, and a certain amount of
      winking and blinking, was sufficiently recovered to take a huge pinch of
      snuff, and ascend the stairs to a private room, with her daughter and
      son-in-law for supporters, and half-a-score waiters and chambermaids, whom
      her hysterical symptoms had assembled, by way of a tail. Seeing her so
      well guarded, I thought it unnecessary to add to the escort. As she left
      the room, there was a clatter of hoofs outside, and looking through the
      window, I saw the coroneted berline whirled rapidly away by four vigorous
      posters. Just then the dinner-bell rang, and the obsequious head-waiter,
      who with profound bows had assisted at the departure of the travellers,
      bustled into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the gentleman who has just left?" I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Excellency, Count J&mdash;&mdash;," replied the man. It was the name
      of a Hungarian nobleman of great wealth, and of reputation almost European
      as one of the most fashionable and successful Lotharios of the dissipated
      Austrian capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And his companion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The celebrated actress, Fraülein Sendel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the cunning but unlucky Van Haubitz been a regular reader of the <i>Theater
      Zeitung</i>, or Journal of the Theatres, he would have seen, in the
      ensuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40a" id="Page_40a">[Pg 40]</a></span>
      number to that whence he derived his information respecting Mademoiselle
      Sendel's confirmed popularity and advantageous engagement, the following
      short but important paragraph:
    </p>
    <p class="blockquot">
      "<span class="smcap">ERRATUM.</span>&mdash;In our yesterday's impression
      an error occurred, arising from a similarity of names. It is Fraülein <i>Ameline</i>
      Sendel who has concluded with the Vienna theatre an engagement equally
      advantageous to herself and the manager. Her elder sister, Fraülein <i>Emilie</i>,
      continues the engagement she has already held for two seasons, as a
      supernumerary <i>soubrette</i>. The amount stated yesterday as her salary
      would still be correct, with the abstraction of a zero. Talent does not
      always run in families."
    </p>
    <p>
      This good-natured paragraph, evidently from the pen of a sulky sub-editor,
      smarting under a lashing for his blunder of the preceding day, did not
      come to my knowledge till some time afterwards, so that the waiter's reply
      to my question concerning Count J&mdash;&mdash;'s travelling-companion
      perplexed me greatly, and plunged me into an ocean of conjectures. In
      fact, my curiosity was so strongly roused, that instead of availing myself
      of the absence of the Dutchman to escape from the hotel, I sat down to
      dinner, resolved not to depart till I heard the mystery explained. I had
      not long to wait. Dinner was just over, when I received a message from Van<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41a" id="Page_41a">[Pg 41]</a></span>
      Haubitz, who earnestly desired to see me. I found him alone, seated at a
      table, his chin resting on his hand, anger, shame, and mortification
      stamped upon his inflamed countenance. A tumbler half full of water stood
      upon the table, beside a bottle of smelling salts; and, upon entering, I
      was pretty sure I heard a sound of sobbing from an inner room, which
      ceased, however, when I spoke. There had evidently been a violent scene.
      Its cause was explained to me by Van Haubitz, at first in rather a
      confused manner, for at each attempt to detail the circumstances he
      interrupted himself by bursts of fury. Owing to this, it was some time
      before I could arrive at a clear understanding of the facts of the case.
      When I did, I could scarcely help feeling sorry for the unfortunate
      schemer, although in truth he richly deserved the disappointment he had
      met. Never was there a more glaring instance of excess of cunning
      overreaching itself,&mdash;for no deception had been practised by Madame
      Sendel and her daughter. They doubtless gave themselves credit for some
      cleverness and more good fortune in enticing a rich banker, with more
      ducats than brains, into their matrimonial nets; and doubtless Fraülein
      Emilie put on her best looks and gowns, her sweetest smiles and most
      becoming bonnets, to lure the lion into the toils. But neither mother nor
      daughter had for a moment imagined that Van Haubitz took the latter for
      the celebrated and successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42a"
      id="Page_42a">[Pg 42]</a></span> actress whose name was known throughout
      Germany, whilst that of poor Emilie, whose talents were of the most humble
      order, had scarcely ever penetrated beyond the wings and greenroom of the
      theatre, where she enacted unimportant characters for the modest
      remuneration of a hundred florins a month. By no means proud of her
      position as an actress, which appeared the more lowly when contrasted with
      her sister's brilliant success, Emilie had seldom referred to things
      theatrical since her acquaintance with Van Haubitz. On his part, the
      Dutchman, conscious of his real motives and anxious to conceal them,
      abstained from all direct reference to Mademoiselle Sendel's great talents
      and their lucrative results, contenting himself with general compliments,
      which passed current without being closely scanned. If he had never heard
      either his wife or mother-in-law make mention of Ameline, it was because
      they were on the worst possible terms with that young lady, who had lived,
      nearly from the period of her first appearance upon the boards, under the
      protection of the accomplished libertine, Count J&mdash;&mdash;, over whom
      she was said to exercise extraordinary influence. When she formed this
      connection, Madame Sendel&mdash;who, in spite of her paint and artificial
      floriculture, had very strict notions of propriety&mdash;wrote her a
      letter of furious reproach, renounced her as her daughter, and prohibited
      Emilie from holding any communication<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_43a" id="Page_43a">[Pg 43]</a></span> with her. Emilie, against
      whose virtue none had ever found aught to say, sorrowfully obeyed; and,
      after two or three ineffectual attempts on the part of Ameline to soften
      her mother's wrath, all communication ceased between them. Their next
      meeting was that at which Van Haubitz and myself were present. Its
      singularity, Madame Sendel's fainting fit, and the resemblance between the
      sisters, brought on inquiries and an explanation; and the Dutchman found,
      to his inexpressible disgust and consternation, that he had encumbered
      himself with a wife he cared nothing for, and a mother-in-law he detested,
      whose joint income was largely stated at one hundred and fifty pounds
      sterling per annum. In his first paroxysm of rage he taunted them with the
      mistake they had made when they thought to secure the love-sick
      millionaire, proclaimed himself in debt, disinherited, and a beggar; and,
      finally, by the violence of his reproaches, drove them trembling and
      weeping from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Haubitz had sent for me to implore my advice in his present difficult
      position; but was so bewildered by passion, and overwhelmed by this sudden
      awakening from his dream of success and prosperity, that he was hardly in
      a condition to listen to reason. His regrets were so selfish as to destroy
      the possibility of sympathy, and I should have left him to his fate and
      his own devices, had I not thought that my so doing would make matters<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44a" id="Page_44a">[Pg 44]</a></span> worse
      for the poor girl who had thus heedlessly linked herself to a
      fortune-hunter. So I remained; after a while he became calmer, and we
      talked over plans for the future. By my suggestion, Madame Sendel and her
      daughter were invited to the conference. The old lady was sulky and
      frightened, and would hardly open her lips; Emilie, on the other hand,
      made a more favourable impression on me than she had ever previously done.
      I now saw, what I had not before suspected, that she was really attached
      to Van Haubitz; hitherto, I had taken her for a mere adventuress,
      speculating on his supposed wealth. She spoke kindly and affectionately to
      him, smiled through the tears brought to her eyes by his recent violence,
      and evidently trembled each time her mother spoke, lest she should vent a
      reproach or refer to his duplicity. She tried to speak confidently and
      cheerfully of the future. They must go immediately to Vienna, she said;
      there she would apply diligently to her profession; the manager had half
      promised her an increase of salary after another year&mdash;she was sure
      she should deserve it, and meanwhile Van Haubitz, with his abilities,
      could not fail to find some lucrative employment. He must get rid of his
      accent, she added with a smile (he spoke a voluble but most execrable
      jargon of mingled Dutch and German), and then he might go upon the stage,
      where she was certain he would succeed. This last suggestion was made
      timidly, as if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45a" id="Page_45a">[Pg
      45]</a></span> feared to hurt the pride of the scapegrace by proposing
      such a plan. There was not a word or an accent of reproach in all she
      said, and I heartily forgave the little coquetry, affectation, and
      vulgarity I had formerly remarked in her, in consideration of the
      intuitive delicacy and good feeling she now displayed. Truly, thought I,
      it is humbling to us, the bearded and baser moiety of humankind, to
      contrast our vile egotism with the beautiful self-devotion of woman, as
      exhibited even in this poor actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Sendel by no means acquiesced in her daughter's project. The
      flesh-pots of Amsterdam had attractions for her, far superior to those of
      a struggling and uncertain existence at Vienna. She evidently leaned upon
      the hope of a reconciliation between Van Haubitz and his father, and
      hinted pretty plainly at the effect that might be produced by a personal
      interview with the obdurate banker. I could see she was arranging matters
      in her queer old noddle upon the approved theatrical principle; the
      penitent son and fascinating daughter-in-law throwing themselves at the
      feet of the melting father, who, with handkerchief to eyes, bestows on
      them a blubbering benediction and ample subsidy. To my surprise, Van
      Haubitz also seemed disposed to place hope in an appeal to his father,
      perhaps as a drowning man clutches at a straw. He may have thought that
      his marriage, imprudent as it was, would be taken as some guarantee of<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46a" id="Page_46a">[Pg 46]</a></span> future
      steadiness, or at least of abstinence from the spendthrift courses which
      had hitherto destroyed all confidence in him. He could hardly expect his
      union with a penniless actress to reinstate him in his father's good
      graces; but he probably imagined he might extract a small annuity, as a
      condition of living at a distance from the friends he had disgraced. He
      asked me what I thought of the plan. I of course did not dissuade him from
      its adoption, and upon the whole thought it his best chance, for I really
      saw no other. After some deliberation and discussion, he seemed nearly to
      have made up his mind, when I was called away to my friends, who had
      returned from their excursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was getting into bed that night, when Van Haubitz knocked at my door,
      and entered the room with a downcast and dejected air, very different from
      his usual boisterous headlong manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am off to Holland," he said; "'tis my only chance, bad though it be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sincerely wish you success," replied I. "In any case, do not despair;
      something will turn up. You have friends in your own country, I have heard
      you say. They will help you to occupation."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good friends over a bottle and a dice-box," said he, "but useless at a
      pinch like this. Pleasant fellows enough, but scamps like"&mdash;myself,
      he was going to add, but did not. "I am come to say<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_47a" id="Page_47a">[Pg 47]</a></span> farewell," he continued.
      "I must be off before daybreak. I have debts in Frankfort, and if my
      departure gets wind, I shall have a dozen duns on my back. Misfortunes
      never come alone. As for paying, it is out of the question. Amongst us we
      have only about enough money to reach Amsterdam. Once there&mdash;<i>à la
      grace de Dieu!</i> but I confess my hopes are small. Thanks for your
      advice&mdash;and for your sympathy too, for I saw this morning you were
      sorry for me, though you did not think I deserved pity. Well, perhaps not.
      God bless you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was leaving the room, but returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you said you should stay at Coblenz before returning to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall probably be there a few days towards the end of the month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. If I succeed, you shall hear from me. What is your address there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Poste restante</i> will find me," I replied, not very covetous of the
      correspondence, and unwilling to give a more exact direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Haubitz nodded and left me. At breakfast the next morning I learned
      that the Dutch baron, as the waiter styled him, had taken his departure at
      peep of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first days of October found me still at Coblenz, lingering amongst the
      valleys and vineyards, and loth to exchange them for the autumnal fogs<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48a" id="Page_48a">[Pg 48]</a></span> and
      emptiness of London. Thither, however, I was compelled to return; and I
      endeavoured to console myself for the necessity by discovering that the
      green Rhine grew brown, the trees scant of leaves, the evenings long and
      chilly. I had heard nothing of Van Haubitz, and had ceased to think of
      him, when, walking out at dusk on the eve of the day fixed for my
      departure, I suddenly encountered him. He had just arrived by a steamboat
      coming up stream; his wife and mother-in-law were with him, and they were
      about to enter a fifth-rate inn, which, two months previously, he would
      have felt insulted if solicited to patronise. I was shocked by the change
      that had taken place in all three of them. In five weeks they had grown
      five years older. Emilie had lost her freshness, her eye its sparkle; and
      the melancholy smile with which she welcomed me made my heart ache. Madame
      Sendel's rotund cheeks had collapsed, she looked cross and jaundiced, and
      more snuffy than ever. Van Haubitz was thin and haggard, his hair and
      mustaches, formerly glossy and well-trimmed, were ragged and neglected,
      his dress, once so smart and carefully arranged, was soiled and slovenly.
      My imagination supplied a rapid and vivid sketch of the anxieties, and
      disappointments, and heart-burnings, which, more than any actual bodily
      privations, had worked so great a change in so short a time. Van Haubitz
      started on seeing me, and faltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49a"
      id="Page_49a">[Pg 49]</a></span> in his pace, as if unwilling to enter the
      shabby hotel in my presence. The hesitation was momentary. "Worse quarters
      than we used to meet in," said he, with a bitter smile. "I will not ask
      you into this dog-hole. Wait an instant, and I will walk with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Badly as I thought of Van Haubitz, and indisposed as I was to keep up any
      acquaintance with him, I had not the heart, seeing him so miserable and
      down in the world, to turn my back upon him at once. So I entered the
      hotel, and waited in the public room. In a few minutes he reappeared with
      the two ladies, and we all four strolled out in the direction of the
      Rhine. I did not ask the Dutchman the result of his journey. It was
      unnecessary. His disheartened air and general appearance told the tale of
      disappointment, of humiliating petitions sternly rejected, of hopes fled
      and a cheerless future. He kept silence the while we walked a hundred
      yards, and then, having left his wife and mother-in-law out of ear-shot,
      abruptly began the tale of his mishaps. As I conjectured, he had totally
      failed in his attempt to mollify his father, who was furious at his
      temerity in appearing before him, and whose rage redoubled when he heard
      of his ill-omened marriage. Unfortunately for Van Haubitz, the jeweller
      and some other tradesmen at Frankfort, so soon as they learned his
      departure, had forwarded their accounts to the care of the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50a" id="Page_50a">[Pg 50]</a></span>
      Amsterdam firm; and, although his father had not the remotest intention of
      paying them, he was incensed in the extreme at the slur thus cast upon his
      house and name. In short, the unlucky artilleryman at once saw he had no
      chance of a single kreuzer, or of the slightest countenance from his
      father. His applications to his brothers, and to one or two more distant
      relatives, were equally unsuccessful. All were disgusted at his
      irregularities, angry at his marriage, incredulous of his promises of
      reform; and, after passing a miserable month in Amsterdam, he set out to
      accompany his wife to Vienna, whither she was compelled to repair under
      pain of fine and forfeiture of her engagement. Although living with rigid
      economy&mdash;on bread and water, as Van Haubitz expressed it&mdash;their
      finances had been utterly consumed by their stay in the Dutch capital, and
      it was only by disposing of every trinket and superfluity (and of
      necessaries too, I feared, when I remembered the slender baggage that came
      up with them from the boat) that they had procured the means of
      travelling, in the cheapest and most humble manner, and with the
      disheartening certainty of arriving penniless at Vienna. Van Haubitz told
      me all this, and many other details, with an air of gloomy despondency. He
      was hopeless, heart-broken, desperate; and certain circumstances of his
      position, which by some would have been held an alleviation, aggravated it<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51a" id="Page_51a">[Pg 51]</a></span> in his
      eyes. He said little of his wife; but, from what escaped him, I easily
      gathered that she had shown strength of mind, good feeling and affection
      for him, and was willing to struggle by his side for a scanty and
      hard-earned subsistence. His cares and irritable mood prevented his
      appreciating her attachment, and he looked upon her as an encumbrance,
      without which he might again rise in the world. He had always entertained
      a confident expectation of enriching himself by marriage; and this hope,
      which had buoyed him up under many difficulties, was now gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have one resource left," said Van Haubitz. "I have pondered over it for
      the last two days, and have almost determined on its adoption."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I decide upon it," he replied, "you shall shortly know. 'Tis a
      desperate one enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      We had insensibly slackened our pace, and at this moment the ladies came
      up. Van Haubitz made a gesture, as of impatience at the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait for me here," he said, and walked away. Without speculating upon the
      motive of his absence, I stood still, and entered into conversation with
      the ladies. We were on the quay. The night was mild and calm, but overcast
      and exceedingly dark. A few feet below us rolled the dark mass of the
      Rhine, slightly swollen by recent rains. A<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_52a" id="Page_52a">[Pg 52]</a></span> light from an adjacent
      window illuminated the spot, and cast a flickering gleam across the water.
      Unwilling to refer to their misfortunes, I spoke to Emilie on some general
      topic. But Madame Sendel was too full of her troubles to tolerate any
      conversation that did not immediately relate to them, and she broke in
      with a long history of grievances, of the hard-heartedness of the
      Amsterdam relations, the cruelty of Emilie's position, her son-in-law's
      helplessness, and various other matters, in a querulous tone, and with
      frightful volubility. The poor daughter, I plainly saw, winced under this
      infliction. I was waiting the smallest opening to interrupt the indiscreet
      old lady, and revert to common-place, when a distant splash in the water
      reached my ears. The women also heard it, and at the same instant a
      presentiment of evil came over us all. Madame Sendel suddenly held her
      tongue and her breath; Emilie turned deadly pale, and without saying a
      word, flew along the quay in the direction of the sound. She had gone but
      a few yards when her strength failed her, and she would have fallen, but
      for my support. There was a shout, and a noise of men running. Leaving
      Madame Van Haubitz to the care of her mother, I ran swiftly along the
      river side, and soon reached a place where the deep water moaned and
      surged against the perpendicular quay. Here several men were assembled,
      talking hurriedly and pointing to the river. Others<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_53a" id="Page_53a">[Pg 53]</a></span> each moment arrived, and
      two boats were hastily shoved off from an adjacent landing-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man in the river," was the reply to my hasty inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so dark that I could not distinguish countenances close to me, and
      at a very few yards even the outline of objects was scarcely to be
      discerned. There were no houses close at hand, and some minutes elapsed
      before lights were procured. At last several boats put off, with men
      standing in the bows, holding torches and lanterns high in the air.
      Meanwhile I had questioned the bystanders, but could get little
      information; none as to the person to whom the accident had happened. The
      man who had given the alarm was returning from mooring his boat to a
      neighbouring jetty, when he perceived a figure moving along the quay a
      short distance in his front. The figure disappeared, a heavy splash
      followed, and the boatman ran forward. He could see no one either on shore
      or in the stream, but heard a sound as of one striking out and struggling
      in the water. Having learned this much, I jumped into a boat just then
      putting off, and bid the rowers pull down stream, keeping a short distance
      from the quay. The current ran strong, and I doubted not that the drowning
      man had been carried along by it. Two vigorous oars-men pulled till the
      blades bent, and the boat, aided by the stream, flew through the water. A
      third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54a" id="Page_54a">[Pg 54]</a></span>
      man held a torch. I strained my eyes through the darkness. Presently a
      small object floated within a few feet of the boat, which was rapidly
      passing it. It shone in the torchlight. I struck at it with a boat-hook,
      and brought it on board. It was a man's cap, covered with oilskin, and I
      remembered that Van Haubitz wore such a one. Stripping off the cover, I
      beheld an officer's foraging cap, with a grenade embroidered on its front.
      My doubts, slight before, were entirely dissipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the search, rendered almost hopeless by the extreme darkness and
      power of the current, was at last abandoned, I hastened to the hotel, and
      inquired for Madame Sendel. She came to me in a state of great agitation.
      Van Haubitz had not returned, but she thought less of that than of the
      state of her daughter, who, since recovering from a long swoon, had been
      almost crazed with anxiety. She knew some one had been drowned, and her
      mind misgave her it was her husband. The foraging-cap, which Madame Sendel
      immediately recognised, removed all uncertainty. The only hope remaining
      was, that Van Haubitz, although carried rapidly away by the power of the
      current, had been able to maintain himself on the surface, and had got
      ashore at some considerable distance down the river, or had been picked up
      by a passing boat. But this was a very feeble hope, and for my own<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55a" id="Page_55a">[Pg 55]</a></span> part,
      and for more than one reason, I placed no reliance on it. I left Madame
      Sendel to break the painful intelligence to her daughter, and went home,
      promising to call again in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had expected, nothing was heard of Van Haubitz, nor any vestige of
      him found, save the foraging-cap I had picked up. Doubtless, the Rhine had
      borne down his lifeless corpse to the country of his birth. The next day
      Coblenz rang with the death of the unfortunate Dutchman. A stranger, and
      unacquainted with the localities, he was supposed to have walked over the
      quay by accident. I thought differently; and so I knew did Madame Sendel
      and Emilie. I saw the former early the next day. She was greatly cast down
      about her daughter, who had passed a sleepless night, and was weak and
      suffering, but who nevertheless insisted on continuing her journey the
      following morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must go," said her mother; "if we delay, Emilie loses her engagement,
      and how can we both live on my poor jointure? Weeping will not bring him
      back, were he worth it. To think of the misery he has caused us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I ventured to hint an inquiry as to their means of prosecuting their
      journey. The old lady understood the intention, and took it kindly. "But
      she needed no assistance," she said; Van Haubitz (and<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_56a" id="Page_56a">[Pg 56]</a></span> this confirmed our strong
      suspicion of suicide) had given their little stock of money into his
      wife's keeping only a few hours before his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon I left Coblenz for England.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      On a certain Wednesday, about ten years after the incidents I have
      sketched, I had been enjoying the excellent acting of Bouffé in two of his
      best characters, and paused for a moment to speak to a friend in the
      crowded lobby of the St James's Theatre. Whilst thus engaged, I became
      aware that I was an object of attention to two persons, whom I had an
      indistinct notion of having seen before, but when or where, or who they
      might be, I had not the remotest idea. One of them was a
      comfortable-looking, middle-aged man, with a bald head, a smooth,
      clean-shaven face, and an incipient ventral rotundity. His complexion was
      clear and wholesome, his countenance good-humoured, his whole appearance
      bespoke an existence free from care, nights of sound sleep, and days of
      tranquil enjoyment. His face was too sleek to be very expressive, but
      there was a shrewd, quick look in the eye, and I set him down in my mind
      as a wealthy German merchant or manufacturer (some small peculiarities of
      costume betrayed the foreigner) come to show London to his wife&mdash;a
      well-favoured dame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57a" id="Page_57a">[Pg
      57]</a></span> fat, fair, but some years short of forty&mdash;who
      accompanied him, and who, as well as her better half, seemed to honour me
      with very particular notice. My confabulation over, I was leaving the
      theatre, when a sleek soft hand was gently passed through my arm. It was
      my friend the stout foreigner. I strained my eyes and my memory, but in
      vain; I felt very puzzled, and doubtless looked so, for he smiled, and
      advancing his head, whispered a name in my ear. It was that of Van
      Haubitz.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started, looked again, doubted, and was at last convinced. <i>Minus</i>
      mustache and whisker, which were closely shaven, and half his hair, of
      which the remainder was considerably grizzled; <i>plus</i> a degree of
      corpulence such as I should never have thought the slender lieutenant of
      artillery capable of acquiring; his heated, sunburnt complexion and
      dissipated look, exchanged for a fresh colour and benevolent placidity&mdash;the
      Dutchman I had left in the Rhine stood beside me in the lobby of the
      French theatre. I turned to the lady: she was less changed than her
      companion, and now that I was upon the track, I recognised Emilie Sendel.
      By this time we were in the street. Van Haubitz handed his wife into a
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and sup with us," he said, "and I will explain."
    </p>
    <p>
      I mechanically obeyed, and in less than three minutes, still tongue-tied
      by astonishment, I alighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58a"

      street adjoining Piccadilly.

      A few lines will convey to the reader the substance of the long
      conversation which kept the resuscitated Dutchman and myself from our beds
      for fully two hours after our unexpected meeting. I had been right in
      supposing that he had thrown himself voluntarily into the river; wrong in
      my belief that he meditated suicide. An excellent swimmer, he had taken
      the water to get rid of his wife. He might certainly have chosen a drier
      method, and have given her the slip in the night-time or on the road; but
      she had shown, whenever he referred to the possibility of their
      separation, such a determination to remain with him at all risks and
      sacrifices, that he felt certain she would pursue him as soon as she
      discovered his absence. He had formed a wild scheme of returning to
      Amsterdam, and haunting his family until, through mere weariness and
      vexation, they supplied him with funds for an outfit to Sumatra. There he
      trusted to redeem his fortunes, as he had heard that others of no greater
      abilities or better character than himself had already done. A more
      extravagant project was never formed, and indeed all his acts, during the
      six weeks that followed his marriage, were more or less eccentric and
      ill-judged. This he admitted, when relating them to me, and probably would
      not have been sorry to place them to the score of actual mental<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59a" id="Page_59a">[Pg 59]</a></span>
      derangement. The redeeming touch in his conduct at that, the most
      discreditable period of his life, was his leaving, as I have already
      mentioned, what money he had to his wife and her mother, reserving but a
      few florins for his own support. With these in his pocket, he proposed
      proceeding on foot to Amsterdam. After landing on the right bank of the
      Rhine, he walked the greater part of the night as the best means of drying
      his saturated garments. When weariness at last compelled him to pause, it
      was not yet daylight, no house was open, and he threw himself on some
      straw in a farmyard. He awoke in a high fever, the result of his
      immersion, of exposure and fatigue, acting on a frame heated and weakened
      by anxiety and mental suffering. He obtained shelter at the neighbouring
      farm-house, whose kind-hearted inhabitants carefully tended him for
      several weeks, during which his life was more than once despaired of. His
      convalescence was long, and not till the close of the year could he resume
      his journey northwards, by short stages, chiefly on foot. Unfavourable as
      his prospects were, his good star had not yet set. This very illness, as
      occasioning a delay, was a stroke of good fortune. Had he at once
      proceeded to Holland, his family, in hopes to get rid of him for ever,
      would probably have given him the small sum he needed for an outfit to the
      Indian Archipelago, and he would have sailed thither before the 31st of
      December, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60a" id="Page_60a">[Pg 60]</a></span>
      which day his father, a joyous liver and confirmed votary of Bacchus, eat
      and drank to such an extent to celebrate the exit of the old year and
      commencement of the new, that he fell down, on his way to his bed, in a
      thundering fit of apoplexy, and was a corpse before morning. The day of
      his funeral, Van Haubitz, footsore and emaciated, and reduced to his last
      pfenning, walked wearily into the city of Amsterdam. There a great
      surprise awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father had not disinherited you?" I exclaimed, when the Dutchman
      made a momentary pause at this point of his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had left a will devising his entire property to my brothers, and not
      even naming me. But a slight formality was omitted, which rendered the
      document of no more value than the parchment it was drawn upon. The
      signature was wanting. My father had the weakness, no uncommon one, of
      disliking whatever reminded him of his mortality. He would have fancied
      himself nearer his grave had he signed his will. And thus he had delayed
      till it was too late. I found myself joint heir with my brothers. By far
      the greater part of my father's large capital was embarked in his bank,
      and in extensive financial operations, which it would have been necessary
      to liquidate at considerable disadvantage, to operate the partition
      prescribed by law. Seeing this, I proposed to my brothers to admit me as
      partner in the firm, with the stipulation that I<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_61a" id="Page_61a">[Pg 61]</a></span> should have no active
      share in its direction, until my knowledge of business and steadiness of
      conduct gave them the requisite confidence in me. After some deliberation
      they agreed to this; and three years later their opinion of me had
      undergone such a change, that two of them retired to estates in the
      country, leaving me the chief management of the concern."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Madame Van Haubitz; when did she rejoin you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Immediately the change in my fortunes occurred. Reckless as I at that
      time was, and utterly devoid of feeling as you must have thought me, I
      could not remember without emotion the disinterested affection, delicacy,
      and unselfishness she had exhibited on discovery of my real circumstances.
      During my long illness I had had time to reflect, and when I left my
      sick-bed in that rude but hospitable German farm-house, it was as a
      penitent for past offences, and with a strong resolution to atone them.
      Within a week after my father's funeral, I was on my way to Vienna, to
      fetch Emilie to the opulent home she had anticipated when she married me.
      Her joy at seeing me was scarcely increased when she heard that I had
      become the rich banker she had at first thought me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Madame Sendel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Returned to Amsterdam with us. There was good about the old lady, and by
      purloining her artificials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62a"
      id="Page_62a">[Pg 62]</a></span> limiting her snuff, and soaking her in
      tea, she was made endurable enough. Until her death, which occurred a
      couple of years ago, she passed her time alternately with us and her
      younger daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She became reconciled to Mademoiselle Ameline?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ameline had been Countess J&mdash;&mdash; all the time. She was privately
      married. For certain family reasons the Count had conditioned that their
      union should for a while be kept secret. Seeing that her equivocal
      position and her mother's displeasure preyed upon her health and spirits,
      he declared his marriage. She left the stage to become a reigning beauty
      in the best society of Austria, lady of half-a-dozen castles, and
      sovereign mistress of as many thousand Hungarian boors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Haubitz remained some time in London, and I saw him often. He was as
      much changed in character as in personal appearance. The sharp lessons
      received about the period of our first acquaintance had made a strong
      impression on him; and the summer tide of prosperity suddenly setting in,
      had enabled him to realise good intentions and honourable resolves, which
      the chill current of adversity might have frozen in the germ. Some of
      those who read these lines may have occasion, when visiting the country
      stigmatised by the snarling Frenchman as the land of <i>canards</i>, <i>canaux</i>,
      and <i>canaille</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63a" id="Page_63a">[Pg
      63]</a></span> to receive cash in the busy counting-house, and hospitality
      in the princely mansion of one of its most respected bankers. None, I am
      well assured, will discern in their amiable and exemplary entertainer any
      vestige of the disreputable impulses and evil passions that sullied the
      early life of "My Friend the Dutchman."

      Oxford! Alma Mater! not to love thee were indeed the ingratitude of a
      degenerate son. Let the whiners of the Conventicle rail at thee for a
      mother of heretics, and the Joseph Humes of domestic economy propose to
      adapt the scale of thy expenses to their own narrow notions&mdash;I uphold
      thee to be the queen of all human institutions&mdash;the incarnated union

      doctrine as orthodox as thy dinners, thy politics as sound as thy port.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oxford! who are they that rail at her? who dare to lift their voice
      against that seat of high and holy memories? The man who boasts a private
      education (so private, that his most intimate friends have never found it
      out), who, innocent himself of all academic experiences and associations,
      grudges to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65a" id="Page_65a">[Pg 65]</a></span>
      others that superiority which they never boast indeed, but to which his
      secret soul bears envious witness. Or the rich nonconformist, risen
      perhaps from obscurity to a rank in society which gives him the choice of
      indulging either his spleen or his pride&mdash;either to send his eldest
      son as a gentleman-commoner to Christ-Church, to swallow the Thirty-nine
      Articles with his champagne; or to have his fling at the Church through
      her universities&mdash;accusing Churchmen of bigotry, and exclusiveness,
      and illiberality, because Dissenters do not found colleges of their own.
      Or, worse than all, the unworthy disciple who (like the noxious plant that
      has grown up beneath the shade of some goodly tree) has drawn no nobility
      of soul from the associations which surrounded his ungrateful youth: for
      whom all the reality and romance of academic education were alike in vain:
      sneering at the honours which he could not obtain, denying the existence
      of opportunities which he neglected; the basest of approvers, he quotes to
      his own eternal infamy the scenes of riot and dissipation, the
      alternations of idleness and extravagance, which make up his sole
      recollections of university life: and looking, without one glance of
      affection, upon the face of his fair and graceful mother, makes the chance
      mole, or the early wrinkle, which he traces there, the subject of his
      irreverent jest, forgets the kindness of which he was unworthy, and
      remembers for evil the wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66a"
      id="Page_66a">[Pg 66]</a></span> discipline which was irksome only to such
      as him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Non hæc jocosæ conveniunt lyræ;"<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I admit mine is not the tongue or pen for such a subject; and Oxford has,
      I hope, no lack of abler champions. But it was geese, you know, who once
      saved the Capitol; and I must have my hiss at the iniquitous quackeries
      which people seek to perpetrate under the taking title of University
      Reform. And when I, loving Oxford as I do, see some of her own sons
      arrayed against her, I can only remember this much of my philosophy&mdash;that
      there are cases when to be angry becomes a duty. Men who, knowing nothing
      of the universities from experience, think proper to run them down,
      succeed at all events in exposing one crying evil&mdash;the absurdity of
      meddling with what one does not understand. We who know better may afford
      to smile at once at their spite and their ignorance. But he who lifts his
      voice against the mother that bore him, can fix no darker blot upon her
      fame than the disgrace of having given birth to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Show me the man who did not like Oxford, and I will show you either a
      sulky misanthrope or an affected ass. Many, many indeed, are the
      unpleasant recollections which, in the case of nearly all of us, will
      mingle with the joy with which we recall our college days. More than the
      ghosts of duns departed, perhaps unpaid; more than the heart-burnings<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67a" id="Page_67a">[Pg 67]</a></span> of
      that visionary fellowship, for which we were beaten (we verily believe,
      unfairly) by a neck; more than that loved and lost ideal of a first class,
      which we deserved, but did not get (the opinions of our examiners not
      coinciding in that point with our own); yes, more than all these, comes
      forcibly to many minds, the self-accusing silent voice that whispers of
      time wasted and talents misapplied&mdash;kind advice, which the heat of
      youth misconstrued or neglected&mdash;jewels of price that once lay
      strewed upon the golden sands of life, then wantonly disregarded, or
      picked up but to be flung away, and which the tide of advancing years has
      covered from our view for ever&mdash;blessed opportunities of acquiring
      wisdom, human and divine, which never can return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in spite of all this, if there be any man who can say that Oxford is
      not to him a land of pleasant memories, "<span lang="el"
      title="Mêt' emoi parestios genoito">Μήτ' ἐμοὶ παρέστιος γένοιτο</span>"&mdash;which
      is, being freely translated, "May he never put his legs under my mahogany"&mdash;that's
      all. I never knew him yet, and have no wish to make his acquaintance. He
      may have carried off every possible university honour for what I care; he
      is more hopelessly stupid, in my view of things, than if he had been
      plucked fifteen times. If he was fond of reading, or of talking about
      reading; fond of hunting, or talking about hunting; fond of walking,
      riding, rowing, leaping, or any possible exercise besides dancing; if he
      loved pleasant gardens or solemn cloisters; learned retirement<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68a" id="Page_68a">[Pg 68]</a></span> or
      unlearned jollification&mdash;in a word, if he had any imaginable human
      sympathies, and cared for anything besides himself, he would have liked
      Oxford. Men's tastes differ, no doubt; but to have spent four years of the
      spring of one's life in one of the most magnificent cities and best
      societies in the world, and not to have enjoyed it&mdash;this is not a
      variety of taste, but its privation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancy there is a mistaken opinion very prevalent, that young and
      foolish, older and wiser, are synonymous terms. Stout gentlemen of a
      certain age, brimful of proprieties, shake their heads alarmingly, and
      talk of the folly of boys; as if they were the only fools. And if at any
      time, in the fulness of their hearts, they refer to some freak of their
      own youth, they appear to do it with a sort of apology to themselves, that
      such wise individuals as they are now should ever have done such things!
      And as the world stands at present, it is the old story of the Lion and
      the Painter; the elderly gentlemen are likely to have it their own way;
      they say what they like, while the young ones are content to do what they
      like. And the more absurdity a man displays in his teens (and some, it
      must be confessed, are absurd enough), the more insupportable an air of
      wisdom does he put on when he gets settled. As there is no hope of these
      sedate gentry being sent to College again to teach the rising generation
      of under-graduates the art of precocious gravity, and<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_69a" id="Page_69a">[Pg 69]</a></span> still less hope of their
      arriving at it of themselves, perhaps there is no harm in mooting the
      question on neutral ground, whether such a consummation as that of putting
      old heads upon young shoulders is altogether desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherefore, I, Frank Hawthorne&mdash;being of the age of nine-and-twenty,
      or thereabouts, and of sound mind, and about to renounce for ever all
      claim and title to be considered a young man; having married a wife, and
      left sack and all other bad habits; having no longer any fellowship with
      under-graduates, or army subs, or medical students, or young men about
      town, or any other class of the heterogeneous irregulars who make up
      "Young England"&mdash;being a perfectly disinterested party in the
      question, inasmuch as having lost my reputation for youth, I have never
      acquired one for wisdom&mdash;hereby raise my voice against the
      intolerable cant, which assumes every man to be a harebrained scapegrace
      at twenty, and a Solomon at forty-five. Youth sows wild oats, it may be;
      too many men in more advanced life seem to me to sow no crop of any kind.
      There are empty fools at all ages; but "an old fool"&mdash;&mdash;(musty
      as the proverb is, it is rather from neglect than over-application). I
      have known men by the dozen, who in their youth were either empty-headed
      coxcombs or noisy sots; does my reader think that any given number of
      additional years has made them able statesmen, sound lawyers,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70a" id="Page_70a">[Pg 70]</a></span> or
      erudite divines? that because they have become honourable by a seat in
      Parliament, learned by courtesy, reverend by office, they are therefore
      really more useful members of society than when they lounged the High
      Street, or woke the midnight echoes of the quadrangle? Nay, life is too
      short for the leopard to change his spots, or the Ethiopian his skin; one
      can but pare the claws of the first, and put a suit of the last European
      fashion upon the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let any man run over in his own mind the list of those school and college
      companions with whom, after the lapse of ten years or so, he has still an
      opportunity of occasionally renewing his acquaintance, and judging of the
      effect which time has had upon their habits and characters. In how many
      cases can he trace any material alteration, beyond what results from the
      mere accidents of time and place? He finds, it is to be hoped, good
      principles developed, warm impulses ripened into active habits,
      exaggerations softened down (for I am giving him credit for not choosing
      his companions, even in youth, among the vicious in heart and principle);
      but if he finds in any what he can call a <i>change</i> at all, then I
      ask, in how many instances is it a change for the better? or does he not
      find it rather where there was no sterling value in the metal, which, as
      the gloss of youth wears off, loses its only charm?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirty is the turning-point of a man's life; when marrying becomes a
      now-or-never sort of business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71a"
      id="Page_71a">[Pg 71]</a></span> and dinners begin to delight him more
      than dancing. As I said just now, then, I stand just at the corner; and,
      looking round before I turn it, I own somewhat of a shyness for the
      company of those "grave and reverend seniors" who are to be my
      fellow-travellers hereafter through life. There are certain points on
      which I fear we are scarce prepared to agree. I must have one window open
      for the first few miles of the journey at all events&mdash;that I may look
      behind me. Life's a fast train, and one can't expect to be allowed to get
      out at the stations; still less to ask the engineer to put back, because
      we have left our youth behind us. Yet there are some things in which I
      hope always to be a boy; I hope ever to prefer thoughtlessness to
      heartlessness, imprudence to selfishness, impulse to calculation. It is
      hard enough to part with all the fiery spirits, the glowing imaginations,
      the elasticity of mind and body which we lose as age creeps on; but if,
      with the bright summer weather and cloudless skies of youth, to which we
      are content to bid farewell, we must lose, too, the "sunshine of the
      breast"&mdash;the "bloom of heart"&mdash;then well might the poet count
      him happy who died in early spring&mdash;who knew nothing of life but its
      fair promises, and passed away in happy scepticism of the winter which was
      to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk of putting old heads upon young shoulders! Heaven forbid! It would
      but be making them stoop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72a"
      id="Page_72a">[Pg 72]</a></span> prematurely. If indeed we could put young
      hearts into old bodies occasionally, we might do some good; or if there
      could ever be combined in some fortunate individual, throughout his life,
      the good qualities peculiar to each successive climacteric; if we could
      mix just enough of the acid and the bitter, which are apt to predominate
      so unhappily after a long rubbing through the world, to qualify the fiery
      spirit of youth, and prevent its sweetness from cloying, the compound
      would undoubtedly be a very pleasant one. But this, it is to be feared,
      like many other desiderata, is too good to be attainable; and the
      experience which we undoubtedly want in early life, we acquire too often
      at the cost of that freshness of heart, which nature intended as a gift
      still more valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowhere does the old Stagyrite display a more consummate knowledge of what
      men are made of, than in his contrasted characters of youth and age. I
      wonder how many of the old gentlemen who call themselves philosophers in
      this degenerate age, ever read or remember what he says on the subject. It
      is a great comfort, when one is arguing against so much collective wisdom,
      to feel that one has such authority to fall back upon; and I have the less
      hesitation in bringing my old friend Aristotle forward to help me, because
      I can assure my unlearned readers, ladies and others, that I am not going
      to quote any thing nearly so grave and sensible as<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_73a" id="Page_73a">[Pg 73]</a></span> modern philosophy.
      "Stingy, illnatured, suspicious, selfish, narrow-minded"&mdash;these, with
      scarce a redeeming quality, are some of the choice epithets which he
      strings together as the characteristics of the respectable old governors
      and dowagers of his day; while the young, although, as he confesses,
      somewhat too much the creatures of impulse, and indebted to it for some of
      their virtues as well as vices, are trustful towards others, honest in
      themselves, open-handed and open-hearted, warm friends and brave enemies.
      It is true, he observes, they have, in a large degree, the fault common to
      all honest men, they are "easily humbugged;" an admitted failing which
      perhaps may let us into the secret of their sitting down so quietly under
      the imputation of a hundred others. He urges, too, elsewhere, a fact I am
      not disposed to battle about, that young men do not make good
      philosophers; but this is in a book which he wrote for the use of his own
      son, wherein he probably thought it his duty to take the conceit out of
      his heir-apparent; but if he ever allowed the young philosopher to get a
      sight of the other book containing the two characters aforesaid, it may be
      doubted whether he found him as "easily humbugged" afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, reader, as I said before, I claim to occupy neutral ground. If I
      essay to defend youth from some injustice which it suffers at the hands of
      partial judges, it is as an amateur advocate rather than<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74a" id="Page_74a">[Pg 74]</a></span> an
      accredited champion&mdash;for I am young no longer. If I am rash enough to
      couch a lance against that venerable phantom, which, under the name of
      Wisdom, hovers round grey hairs, I am but preparing a rod for my own back&mdash;for
      I feel myself growing old. I admit it with a sigh; but the sigh is not for
      the past only, but even more for the present. I mourn not so much for that
      which Time has taken away, as for the insufficiency of that which it
      brings instead. I would rejoice to be relieved from the dominion of the
      hot follies of youth, if I could escape at the same time the degrading
      yoke of the cooler vices of maturity. I do not find men grow better as
      they grow older; wiser they may grow, but it is the wisdom of the serpent.
      We scarce grow less sensual, less vain, less eager after what we think
      pleasure; I would we continued as generous and as warm. We gain the
      cunning to veil our passions, to regulate even our vices according to the
      scale (and that no parsimonious one) which what we call "society" allows;
      we lose the enthusiasm which in some degree excused our follies, with the
      light-heartedness which made them delightful. Few men among us are they
      who can look back upon the years gone by, and not feel that, if these may
      justly be charged with folly, the writing of the accusation that stands
      against their riper age is of a graver sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is melancholy, rather than amusing, to hear<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_75a" id="Page_75a">[Pg 75]</a></span> men of a certain age rail
      against the faults and extravagance of their juniors. Angry that they
      themselves are no longer young, they visit with a rod of iron such an
      intolerable offence in others. Even newspapers are always eloquent against
      the disgusting immoralities of breaking knockers and bonneting policemen.
      The <i>Times</i> turns censor upon such an "ungentlemanly outrage;" the <i>Weekly
      Despatch</i> has its propriety shocked by such "freaks of the
      aristocracy;" and both, in their zeal to reprobate offences so dangerous
      to the best interests of society, sacrifice somewhat of that "valuable
      space" which should have been devoted to the bulletin of the health, or
      the history of the travels, of the "gallant officer" who last deliberately
      shot his friend in a duel; or the piquant details of the last <i>crim.
      con.</i>, with the extraordinary disclosures expected to be made by the
      "noble defendant." Society has no sympathy with vices to which it has no
      temptation; it might have done foolish things in its day, but has long ago
      seen the folly of them. So we make a graceful acknowledgment of having
      been wrong once, for the sake of congratulating ourselves upon being so
      very right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me then, for some few moments, recall those scenes which, on the stage
      of life, have passed away for ever; and forgetting, as memory loves to do,
      the evil that was in them, let it be not idle repining to lament the good.

      Oh! dark yet pleasant quadrangle, round whose wide area I might wander
      now, a stranger among strangers, where are they who once gave life and
      mirth to cheer those ancient walls? There were full a score of rooms,
      congenial <i>lares</i>, in which no hour of day or night would have found
      me other than a welcome guest. I had friends, yea, friends, within those
      prison-like windows&mdash;warm hearts walled in by thy cold grey stones&mdash;friends
      that had thoughts, and feelings, and pursuits in common&mdash;who were not
      hospitable in words alone, suffering each other's presence with
      well-concealed <i>ennui</i>&mdash;but friends in something more than in
      the name. In vain, among the cold conventionalities of life, shall I look
      for the warm and kindly welcome, the sympathy of feeling, the unrestrained
      yet courteous familiarity of intercourse, which was part and parcel of a
      college life; and if for this only I should say of Oxford, that I shall
      not look upon its like again&mdash;if for this only, I doubt whether the
      years of my youthful pilgrimage were altogether evil, who shall gainsay
      me? Where, or in what society of wise, and orderly, and respectable
      "grown-up children," shall I find the sincerity and warm-heartedness that
      once were the atmosphere of my daily life? Where is the friend of my
      maturer choosing, into whose house I can walk at any time, and feel sure I
      am no intruder? Where is the man, among those with whom I am by hard fate
      compelled to associate, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77a"
      id="Page_77a">[Pg 77]</a></span> does not measure his regard, his
      hospitality, his very smiles, by my income, my station in society&mdash;anything
      but by myself? Older and wiser!&mdash;oh yes!&mdash;youthful friendship is
      very foolish in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I suppose I must put up, as I best may, with the accumulating weight
      of years and wisdom. It won't do to give up one's degree, and begin again
      at the university, even if they leave us a university worth going to. At
      all events, one could not go back and find there those "old familiar
      faces" that made it what it was; and it is more pleasant to look upon it
      all&mdash;the place and its old occupants&mdash;as still existing in some
      dream-land or other, than to return to find an old acquaintance in every
      stick and stone, while every human face and voice is strange to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet one does meet friends in old scenes, sometimes, when the meeting is as
      unexpected as delightful. And just so, in my last visit to Oxford, did I
      stumble upon Horace Leicester. We met in the quadrangle where we had
      parted some six years back, just as we might if we had supped together the
      night before; whereas we had been all the time hundreds of miles asunder:
      and we met as unrestrainedly, only far more cordially. Neither of us had
      much time to spare in Oxford, but we dined together of course; talked over
      old friends, and told old stories. As to the first, it was strange enough
      to moralise upon the after-fortunes of some of our contemporaries. One&mdash;of
      whom, for habitual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78a" id="Page_78a">[Pg
      78]</a></span> absence from lectures, and other misdemeanours many and
      various, the tutors had prophesied all manner of evil, and who had been
      dismissed by the Principal at his final leave-taking, with the remark that
      he was the luckiest man he had ever known, inasmuch as he had been
      perseveringly idle without being plucked, and mixed up in every row
      without being rusticated&mdash;was now working hard day and night as a
      barrister, engaged as a junior on committee business the whole Session,
      and never taking a holiday except on the Derby day. The ugliest little
      rascal of our acquaintance, and as stupid as a post, was married to a
      pretty girl with a fortune of thirty thousand. Another, and one of the
      best of us&mdash;Charley White&mdash;who united the business-habits of a
      man with the frolic of a schoolboy, and who ought to have been added to
      the roll of the College benefactors, as having been the founder of the
      Cricket and the Whist Club, and having restored to its old place on the
      river, at much cost and pains, the boat which had been withdrawn for the
      last five years, and reduced the sundry desultory idlenesses of the
      under-graduates into something like method and order&mdash;Charley White
      was now rector of a poor and populous parish in Yorkshire, busily engaged
      in building a new church and schools, opening Provident Societies, and
      shutting up beer-shops, and instructing the rising generation of his
      parishioners in catechism and cricket alternately. While the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79a" id="Page_79a">[Pg 79]</a></span>
      steadiest (I was very near saying the only steady man) among our mutual
      acquaintance, who looked at every sixpence before he spent it, checked his
      own washing-lists, went to bed at ten o'clock, and was, in short, an
      exemplary character (he was held out to me, on my first entrance, as a
      valuable acquaintance for any young man, but I soon despaired of
      successfully imitating so bright a model)&mdash;well, this gentleman
      having been taken into partnership, somewhat prematurely perhaps on the
      strength of the aforesaid reputation, by his father's firm&mdash;they were
      Liverpool merchants of high standing&mdash;had thought proper, disgusted
      probably with the dissipations and immoralities of trade, to retire to
      America in search of purity and independence, without going through the
      form of closing his accounts with the house. The Liverpudleians, indeed,
      according to Horace's account, gave a somewhat ugly name to the
      transaction; he had been cashier to the firm, they said, who were minus
      some tens of thousands thereby; but as the senior partner was known to
      have smoked cigars at a preparatory school (thereby showing what he <i>would</i>
      have done had he been sent to Oxford), whereas our friend was always "a
      steady man," I leave the reader to judge which party is entitled to the
      most credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after we had separated that a friend of mine, not an Oxford man,
      who had dined with us, and appeared much amused by some of Horace's<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80a" id="Page_80a">[Pg 80]</a></span>
      reminiscences, asked me the very puzzling question, "Was your friend
      Leicester what they call a '<i>rowing</i> man' at College?" Now, I protest
      altogether against the division of under-graduates into reading men and
      rowing men, as arbitrary and most illogical; there being a great many who
      have no claim to be reckoned either in one class or the other, and a great
      many who hover between both. And this imaginary distinction, existing as
      it notoriously does at Oxford, and fostered and impressed upon men by the
      tutors (often unintentionally, or with the very best intentions), is
      productive in many cases of a great deal of harm. A man (or <i>boy</i> if
      you please) is taught to believe, upon his very first entrance, that one
      of these characters will infallibly cling to him, and that he has only to
      choose between the two. For the imaginary division creates a real one; in
      many colleges, a man who joins a boat's crew, or a cricket club, or goes
      out now and then with the harriers, is looked upon with suspicion by the
      authorities at once; and by a very natural consequence, a man who wants to
      read his five or six hours a-day quietly, finds that some of his
      pleasantest companions look upon him as a slow coach. So, probably before
      the end of his first term, he is hopelessly committed, at nineteen, to a
      consistency of character rarely met with at fifty. If he lays claim to the
      reputation of a reading man, and has an eye to the loaves and fishes in
      the way of scholarships and fellowships,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_81a" id="Page_81a">[Pg 81]</a></span> he is compelled, by the
      laws of his <i>caste</i>, to renounce some of the most sensible and
      healthful amusements which a university life offers. He must lead a very
      humdrum sort of life indeed. It is not enough that he should be free from
      the stains of vice and immorality; that his principles and habits should
      be those of a gentleman; that he should avoid excesses, and be observant
      of discipline; this the university would have a right to expect from all
      who are candidates for her honours and emoluments. But there is a
      conventional character which he must put on besides this. I say "put on;"
      because, however natural it may be to some men, it cannot possibly be so
      to all. His exercise must be taken at stated times and places: it must
      consist principally of walking, whether he be fond of it or not, varied
      occasionally by a solitary skiffing expedition down the river, or a game
      of billiards with some very steady friend on the sly. His dress must
      exhibit either the negligence of a sloven (in case he be an aspirant for
      very high honours indeed), or the grave precision of a respectable
      gentleman of forty. He must eschew all such vanities as white trousers and
      well-cut boots. He must be profoundly ignorant of all university
      intelligence that does not bear in some way on the schools; must be
      utterly indifferent what boat is at the head of the river, or whether
      Drake's hounds are fox or harriers. He must never be seen out of his
      rooms, except at lecture, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82a"
      id="Page_82a">[Pg 82]</a></span> two o'clock, and never return to a
      wine-party after chapel. His judgment of the merits of port and sherry
      must be confined principally to the fact of one being red and the other
      white, and the compounding of punch must be to him a mystery unfathomable.
      Now, if he can be, or assume to be, all this, then he will be admitted
      into the most orthodox and steady set in his college; and if he have,
      besides, an ordinary amount of scholarship, and tact enough to talk
      judiciously about his books and his reading, he may get up a very fair
      reputation indeed. And when at his final examination he makes, as
      nine-tenths of such men do make, a grand crash, and his name comes out in
      the third or fourth class, or he gets "gulfed" altogether&mdash;it is two
      to one but his friends and his tutor look upon him, and talk of him, as
      rather an ill-used individual. He was "unlucky in his examination"&mdash;"the
      essay did not suit him"&mdash;they were "quite surprised at his failure"&mdash;"his
      health was not good the last term or two"&mdash;"he was too nervous."
      These are cases which have occurred in every man's experience: men read
      ten hours a-day, with a watch by their side, cramming in stuff that they
      do not understand, are talked about as "sure firsts" till one gets sick of
      their very names, assume all the airs which really able men seldom do
      assume, and take at last an equal degree with others who have been
      acquiring the same amount of knowledge with infinitely less<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83a" id="Page_83a">[Pg 83]</a></span>
      pretension, and who, without moping the best part of their lives in an
      artificial existence, will make more useful members of society in the end.
      "How was it," said an old lady in the country to me one day, "that young
      Mr C&mdash;&mdash; did not get a first class? I understand he read very
      hard, and I know he refused every invitation to dinner when he was down
      here in the summer vacation?" "That was the very reason, my dear madam,"
      said I; "you may depend upon it." She stared, of course; but I believe I
      was not far out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let men read as much as they will, and as hard as they will, on any
      subjects for which they have the ability and inclination; but never let
      them suppose they are to lay down one code of practice to suit all tempers
      and constitutions. Cannot a man be a scholar, and a gentleman, and a good
      fellow at the same time?
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after all, where is the broad moral distinction between these <i>soi-disant</i>
      steady men, and those whom they are pleased to consider as "rowing"
      characters? it has always seemed to me rather apocryphal. If a man thinks
      proper to amuse himself with a chorus in his own rooms at one o'clock in
      the morning, it seems hardly material whether it be Greek or English&mdash;Sophocles
      or Tom Moore. It's a matter of taste, and tastes differ. Nor do I think
      the morality of Horace or Aristophanes, or the theology of Lucretius, so
      peculiarly admirable, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84a"
      id="Page_84a">[Pg 84]</a></span> to render them, <i>per se</i>, fitter
      subjects for the exclusive exercise of a young man's faculties than "the
      Pickwick Papers," or "The Rod and the Gun." I have heard&mdash;(I never
      saw, nor will I believe it)&mdash;of the profanity of certain sporting
      under-graduates, who took into chapel the racing calendar, bound in red
      morocco, instead of a prayer-book; I hold it to have been the malicious
      fiction of some would-be university reformer; but, even if true, I am not
      sure that I much prefer that provident piety which I have noticed getting
      up its Greek within the same walls by means of a Septuagint and Greek
      liturgy. Religion is one thing, classical learning another, and sporting
      information another; all totally distinct, and totally different; the
      first immeasurably above the other two, but standing equidistant from
      both. It does not make a man one whit the better to know that Coræbus won
      the cup at Olympia <span class="small">B.C.</span> 776, than it does to
      know that Priam did <i>not</i> win the St Leger at Doncaster <span
      class="small">A.D.</span> 1830; from all I can make out, the Greeks on the
      turf at present are not much worse than their old namesakes; I dare say
      there was a fair amount of black-legism on both occasions. Men injure
      their moral and physical health by reading as much as by other things; it
      takes quite as much out of a man, and puts as little in him to any good
      purpose, to get up his logic as to pull in an eight-oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, if one is to read and enter into the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_85a" id="Page_85a">[Pg 85]</a></span> of a dozen different
      authors, one dull monotonous round of physical existence seems ill-fitted
      to call out the requisite variety of mental powers. I hold that there are
      divers and sundry fit times, and places, and states of mind, suited to
      different lines of reading. If a man is at work upon history, by all means
      let him sport oak rigidly against all visitors; let him pile up his
      authorities and references on every vacant chair all round him, and get a
      clear notion of it by five or six hours' uninterrupted and careful study.
      Or, if he has a system of philosophy to get up, let him sit down with his
      head cool, his window open (not the one looking into quad.), let him
      banish from his mind all minor matters, and not break off in the chain of
      argument so long as he can keep his brain clear and his eyes open. Even
      then, a good gallop afterwards, or a cigar and a glass of punch, with some
      lively fellow who is no philosopher, will do him far more good than a
      fagging walk of so many measured miles, with the studious companion whose
      head is stuffed as full of such matter as his own, and whose talk will be
      of disputed passages, and dispiriting anticipations of a "dead floorer" in
      the schools. But if a man wants to make acquaintance with such books as
      Juvenal, or Horace, or Aristophanes, he may surely do it to quite as good
      purpose, and with far more relish, basking under a tree in summer, or with
      a friend over a bottle in winter.

    <p>
      The false tone of society of which I have been speaking had its influence
      upon Horace Leicester. Coming up to the university from a public school,
      with a high character, a fair amount of scholarship, and a host of
      acquaintances, he won the good-will at once of dons and of
      under-graduates, and bid fair to be as universal a favourite at college as
      he had been at Harrow. Never did a man enter upon an academic life under
      happier auspices, nor, I believe, with a more thorough determination to
      enjoy it in every way. He did not look upon his emancipation from school
      discipline as a license for idleness, nor intend to read the less because
      he could now read what he pleased, and when he pleased. For, not to
      mention that Horace was ambitious, and had at one time an eye to the class
      list&mdash;he had a taste for reading, and a strong natural talent to
      appreciate what he read. But if he had a taste for reading, he had other
      tastes as well, and, as he thought, not incompatible; much as he admired
      his Roman namesake, he could not devote his evenings exclusively to his
      society, but preferred carrying his precepts into practice occasionally
      with more modern companions; and he had no notion that during the next
      four years of his life he was to take an interest in no sports but those
      of the old Greeks and Romans, and mount no horse but Pegasus. For a term
      or two, Leicester got on very well; attended lectures, read steadily till
      one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87a" id="Page_87a">[Pg 87]</a></span>
      two o'clock, when there was nothing particular going on, kept a horse,
      hired an alarm, and seldom cut morning chapel, or missed a meet if within
      reasonable distance. It was a course of life which, in after days, he
      often referred to with a sigh as having been most exemplary; and I doubt
      whether he was far wrong. But it did not last. For a time his gentlemanly
      manners, good humour, and good taste, carried it off with all parties; but
      it was against the ordinary routine, and could not hold up against the
      popular prejudice. The reading men eyed his top-boots with suspicion; the
      rowing men complained he was growing a regular <i>sap</i>, always sporting
      oak when they wanted him. Then his wine-parties were a source of endless
      tribulation to him. First of all, he asked all those with whom he was most
      intimate among his old schoolfellows to meet each other, adding one or two
      of his new acquaintances: and a pretty mess he made of it. Men who had sat
      on the same form with him and with each other at Harrow, and had betrayed
      no such marked differences in their tastes as to prevent their associating
      very pleasantly there, at Oxford, he found, had been separated wide as the
      poles by this invisible, but impassable, line of demarcation: to such a
      degree, indeed, that although all had called upon Horace, as they had upon
      each other, before it seemed decided on which side they were to settle,
      yet when they now met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88a" id="Page_88a">[Pg
      88]</a></span> at his rooms, they had become strangers beyond a mere civil
      recognition, and had not a single subject to converse upon in common. In
      fact, they were rather surprised than pleased to meet at all; and it was
      in vain their host tried to get them to amalgamate. Many seemed to take a
      pleasure in showing how decidedly they belonged to one set or the other.
      One would talk of nothing on earth besides hunting, and sat silent and
      sulky when Horace turned the conversation; another affected an utter
      ignorance of all that was going on in the University that was not
      connected with class-lists, scholarships, &amp;c. What provoked him most
      was, that some of those who gave themselves the most pedantic airs, and
      would have been double first-class men undeniably, if talking could have
      done it, were those whose heads he well knew were as empty as the last
      bottle, and which made him think that some men must take to reading at
      Oxford, simply because they had faculties for nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, Horace found the mixed system would not answer for
      entertaining his friends. So the next time he asked a few of the reading
      men, some of whom he knew used to be good fellows, together; and as he
      really had a kindred taste with them on many subjects, he found an hour or
      so pass away very pleasantly: when just as he was passing the wine about
      the third round, and his own brilliancy and good-humour were beginning to
      infect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89a" id="Page_89a">[Pg 89]</a></span>
      some of his guests&mdash;so that one grave genius of twenty had actually
      so far forgotten himself as to fill a bumper by mistake&mdash;up jumped
      the senior man of the party, and declaring that he had an engagement to
      walk with a friend at seven, politely took his leave. This was the signal
      for a general dispersion; in vain did Horace assure them they should have
      some coffee in the course of an hour, and entreat some one or two to
      return. Off they all went, with sundry smiles and shakes of the head, and
      left their unfortunate host sitting alone in his glory over the first
      glass of a newly opened bottle of claret.
    </p>
    <p>
      I happened to be crossing the quadrangle from chapel in company with
      Savile, at the moment when Leicester put his head out of his window as if
      to inquire of the world in general what on earth he was to do with himself
      for the next hour or two. Savile he hailed at once, and begged him to come
      up; and though I knew but little of him, and had never been in his rooms
      before, still, as I was one or two terms his senior, there was nothing
      contrary even to Oxford etiquette in my accompanying Savile. We laughed
      heartily when he explained his disappointment. Savile tried to comfort him
      by the assurance that, as he had an hour to spare, he would sit down and
      help him to finish a bottle or two of claret with a great deal of
      pleasure; and was inclined to attribute the failure of the evening, in a
      great measure, to his name not having been<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_90a" id="Page_90a">[Pg 90]</a></span> included in the list of
      invitations&mdash;an omission by which he declared all parties had been
      the losers; Horace's reading friends standing very much in need of some
      one to put a little life into them, and himself, as a candidate for a
      degree, having missed a fair opportunity of meeting, among so many choice
      fellows, some one to "put him up to the examiners' dodges." But Leicester
      was irrecoverably disgusted. Nothing, he declared, would ever induce him
      to ask a party of reading men to his rooms again; and from that hour he
      seemed to eschew fellowship with the whole fraternity. Not that he became
      idle all at once; on the contrary, I believe, for some time he worked on
      steadily, or at least tried to work; but he was naturally fond of society,
      and having failed to find what he wanted, was reduced to make the best of
      such as he could find. So he gradually became acquainted with a set of men
      who, whatever their good qualities might be, had certainly no claim
      whatever to be considered hard readers, and who would have considered a
      symposium which broke up at seven o'clock as unsatisfactory as a tale
      without a conclusion. Amongst these, his gentlemanly manners and kindness
      of heart made him beloved, while his talents gave him a kind of influence;
      and, though he must have felt occasionally that he was not altogether in
      his right place, and that, besides his popular qualities, he had higher
      tastes and endowments with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91a"
      id="Page_91a">[Pg 91]</a></span> the majority of his companions could
      hardly sympathise, he was too light-hearted to philosophise much on the
      subject, and contented himself with enjoying his popularity, occasionally
      falling back upon his own resources, and keeping up, in a desultory kind
      of way, his acquaintance with scholarship and literature. The reading men
      of course looked upon him as a lost sheep; the tutors shook their heads
      about him; if he did well, it was set down as the result of accident;
      while all his misdoings were labouring in his vocation. For, agreeably to
      the grand division aforesaid, Horace was now set down as a "rowing-man;"
      and he soon made the discovery, and did more thereupon to deserve the
      character than he ever would have done otherwise. He was very willing to
      go on in his own way, if all parties would but let him alone; he was not
      going to be made a proselyte to long walks, and toast and water, nor had
      he any conscientious abhorrence of supper-parties; and, as his prospects
      in life were in no way dependent upon a class or a scholarship, and he
      seemed to be tacitly repudiated by the <i>literati</i> of his college,
      young and old, on account of some of his aforesaid heterodox notions on
      the subject of study, he accustomed himself gradually to set their
      opinions at defiance; while the moderate reading, which encouragement and
      emulation had made easy at school, became every day more and more
      distasteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92a" id="Page_92a">[Pg 92]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace's tottering reputation was at last completely overset in the eyes
      of the authorities by a little affair which was absurd enough, but in
      which he himself was as innocent as they were. It happened that a youthful
      cousin of his, whose sole occupation for the last twelve months of his
      life had been the not over-profitable one of waiting for a commission, had
      come up to Oxford for two or three days, pursuant to invitation, to see a
      little of the manners and customs of the inhabitants. I think he had some
      slight acquaintance with our then vice-principal&mdash;a good-natured,
      easy man&mdash;and Horace had got leave for him to occupy a set of very
      small, dark rooms, which, as the college was not very full, had been
      suffered to remain vacant for the last two or three terms; they were so
      very unattractive a domicile that the last Freshman to whom they were
      offered as a Hobson's choice, was currently reported, in the plenitude of
      his disgust, to have taken his name off the books <i>instanter</i>. It is
      not usual to allow strangers to sleep within college walls at all; but our
      discipline was somewhat lax in those days. So Mr Carey had a bed put up
      for him in the aforesaid quarters. He was, of course, duly <i>fêted</i>,
      and made much of by Horace and his friends; and a dozen of us sat down to
      a capital dinner in the rooms of the former, on the strength of having to
      entertain a "stranger from the country;" the hospitality of Oxford
      relaxing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93a" id="Page_93a">[Pg 93]</a></span>
      its rules even in favour of under-graduates upon such occasions. It must
      have been somewhere towards the next morning, when two or three of us
      accompanied young Carey down to No. 8; and, after chatting with him till
      he was half undressed, left him, as we thought, safe and quiet. However,
      soon after we had retired, some noisy individual in the same staircase
      thought proper to give a view-hollo out of his window, for the purpose of
      wishing the public good-night. Now there was one of the Fellows, a
      choleric little old gentleman, always in residence, holding some office,
      in which there was as little to do, and as much to get as might be, and
      who seldom troubled himself much about college discipline, and looked upon
      under-graduates with a sort of silent contempt; never interfering with
      them, as he declared himself, so long as they did not interfere with him.
      But one point there was, in which they did interfere with his personal
      comfort occasionally, and whereby his peace of mind and rest of body were
      equally disturbed. Mr Perkins always took a tumbler of negus at ten
      precisely, and turned in as the college clock struck the quarter past; by
      the half-hour he was generally asleep, for his digestion was good and his
      cares few. But his slumbers were not heavy, and anything like a row in the
      quadrangle infallibly awoke him, and then he was like a lion roused. He
      was wont to jump up, throw up his window, thrust out a red face and a
      white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94a" id="Page_94a">[Pg 94]</a></span>
      nightcap, and after listening a few seconds for the chance of the odious
      sounds being repeated, would put the very pertinent question usual in such
      circumstances, to which one so seldom gets an equally pertinent reply&mdash;"Who's
      that?" In case this intimation of Mr Perkins being wide awake proved
      sufficient, as it often did, to restore quiet, then after the lapse of a
      few more seconds the head and the nightcap disappeared, and the window was
      shut down again. But if the noise was continued, as occasionally it was
      out of pure mischief, then in a minute or two the said nightcap would be
      seen to emerge hastily from the staircase below, in company with a
      dressing-gown and slippers, and Mr Perkins in this disguise would proceed
      to the scene of disturbance as fast as his short legs could carry him. He
      seldom succeeded in effecting a capture; but if he had that luck, or if he
      could distinguish the tone of any individual voice so as to be able to
      identify the performer, he had him up before the "seniority" next morning,
      where his influence as one of the senior fellows insured a heavy sentence.
      But he had been engaged in so many unsuccessful chases of the kind, and
      his short orations from his window so often elicited only a laugh, though
      including sometimes brief but explicit threats of rustication against the
      noisy unknown, strengthened by little expletives which, when quoted by
      under-graduates, were made to sound somewhat doubtfully&mdash;that<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95a" id="Page_95a">[Pg 95]</a></span> at
      last he altered his tactics, and began to act in silence. And so he did,
      when upon opening his window he saw a light in the ground-floor rooms of
      the staircase whence the sounds proceeded on the evening in question.
      Carey, by his own account, was proceeding quietly in his preparations for
      bed, singing to himself an occasional stanza of some classical ditty which
      he had picked up in the course of the evening, and admiring the power of
      the man's lungs in the room above him, when he heard a short quick step,
      and then a double rap at his door. He was quite sufficiently acquainted,
      by this time, with the ways of the place, not to be much surprised at the
      late visit, and at the same time to consider it prudent to learn the name
      and <i>status</i> of his visitor before admitting him; so he retorted upon
      Mr Perkins, quite unconsciously, his own favourite query&mdash;"Who's
      that?" his first and obvious impression being that it was one of the party
      he had just quitted, coming probably in the plenitude of good fellowship,
      to bring him an invitation to wine or breakfast next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's me, sir&mdash;open the door," was the reply from a deep baritone,
      which the initiated would never have mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you?" said Carey again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Perkins, sir: have the goodness to let me in." He was getting
      more angry, and consequently more polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96a" id="Page_96a">[Pg 96]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perkins," said Carey, pausing in his operations, in the vain endeavour to
      recall the name among the score or two to whom he had been introduced.
      "I'm just in bed&mdash;were you up at Leicester's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open the door, sir, if you please, immediately," and then came what our
      friend took for a smothered laugh, but was really a sort of shiver, for
      there was a draft in the passage playing all manner of pranks with the
      dressing-gown, and Mr Perkins was getting cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      An indistinct notion came into Carey's mind, that some one who had met him
      in College might have taken him for a Freshman, and had some practical
      joke in view; so he contented himself with repeating that he was going to
      bed, and could let no one in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, sir, I'm Mr Perkins; don't you know me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you a very good night, Mr Perkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your name, sir? eh? You impudent young puppy, what's your infernal
      name? I'll have you rusticated, you dog&mdash;do you hear me, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      On a sudden it struck Carey that this might possibly be a domiciliary
      visit from one of the authorities, and that his best plan was to open the
      door at once, though what had procured him such an honour he was at a loss
      to imagine. He drew back the spring lock, therefore, and the next moment
      stood face to face with the irate Mr Perkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first impulse was to laugh at the curious<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_97a" id="Page_97a">[Pg 97]</a></span> figure before him; but
      when demands for his name, and threats of unknown penalties, were
      thundered forth upon him with no pause for a reply, then he began to think
      that he had made a mistake in opening the door at all&mdash;that he might
      get Leicester into a scrape if not himself&mdash;and as his person was as
      unknown to Mr Perkins as that gentleman's to him, it struck him that if he
      could give him the slip at once it would be all right. In a moment he blew
      out his solitary candle, bolted through the open door, all but upsetting
      his new acquaintance, whom he left storming in the most unconnected
      manner, alone, and in total darkness. Up to Leicester's rooms he rushed,
      related his adventure, and was rather surprised that his cousin did not
      applaud it as a very clever thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Mr Perkins thought or said to himself, what degree of patience he
      exhibited in such trying circumstances, or in what terms he apostrophised
      his flying enemy, must ever remain a secret with himself. Five minutes
      after, Solomon the porter, summoned from his bed just as he had made
      himself snug once more after letting out Horace's out-college friends,
      confronted Mr Perkins in about as sweet a temper as that worthy individual
      himself, with this difference, that one was sulky and the other furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who lives in the ground-floor on the left in No. 8?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98a" id="Page_98a">[Pg 98]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, in 'Coventry?' Why, nobody, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody! you stupid old sinner, you're asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, I ain't," and Solomon flashed his lantern in Mr Perkins's face
      as if to ascertain whether <i>his</i> eyes were open. Mr Perkins started
      back, and Solomon turned half round as if to disappear again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who lives there, Solomon, I ask you? Do you mean to tell me you don't
      know? You are not fit&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knows every gentleman's rooms well enough: nobody hasn't lived in them
      as you means not these four terms. Mr Pears kept his fox in 'em one time,
      till the vice-principal got wind of him. There may be some varmint in 'em
      now for all I knows&mdash;they a'n't fit for much else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's some confounded puppy of a Freshman in them now&mdash;at least
      there was&mdash;and he lives there too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know there <i>be'n't</i>," said the persevering Solomon. And, without
      deigning a word more, he set off with his lantern towards the place in
      dispute, followed by Mr Perkins, who contented himself with an angry "Now
      you'll see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, now we shall see," replied Solomon, as, somewhat to Mr Perkins's
      astonishment, they found the oak sported. Having made a selection from a
      huge bunch of keys, the porter succeeded, after some fumbling, in getting
      the door open. The room bore no traces of recent occupation. Three or four
      broken chairs and a rickety table were the only furniture:<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99a" id="Page_99a">[Pg 99]</a></span> as far
      as the light of Solomon's lantern could penetrate, it looked the very
      picture of desolation. Solomon chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There <i>is</i> a man living here. I'll swear there is. He was undressing
      when I came. Look in the bedroom."
    </p>
    <p>
      They opened the door, and saw a bare feather-bed and bolster, the usual <i>matériel</i>
      in an unoccupied college chamber. "Seeing's believing," said the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, with Mr Perkins, seeing was not believing. He saw Solomon, and he saw
      the empty room, but he did not believe either. But he had evidently the
      worst side of the argument as it stood, so he wished the porter a sulky
      good-night, and retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, that the noisy gentleman in the rooms above, as soon as he
      caught the tones of Mr Perkins's voice at Carey's door, had entered into
      the joke with exceeding gusto, well aware that the visit was really
      intended as a compliment to his own vocal powers. Carey's sudden bolt
      puzzled him rather; but as soon as he heard Mr Perkins's foot-steps take
      the direction of the porter's lodge, he walked softly down-stairs to the
      field of action, and, anticipating in some degree what would follow,
      bundled up together sheets, blankets, pillow, dressing apparatus, and all
      other signs and tokens of occupation, and made off with them to his own
      rooms, sporting the oak behind him, and thus completing the mystification.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the facts of the case were pretty sure to transpire<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_100a" id="Page_100a">[Pg 100]</a></span> in course of time,
      Horace took the safe course of getting his cousin out of college next
      morning, and calling on Mr Perkins with a full explanation of the
      circumstances, and apologies for Carey as a stranger unacquainted with the
      police regulations of their learned body, and the respect due thereto. Of
      course the man in authority was obliged to be gracious, as Leicester could
      not well be answerable for all the faults of his family; but there never
      from that time forth happened a row of any kind with which he did not in
      his own mind, probably unconsciously, associate poor Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether my readers will set down Horace Leicester as a rowing man or not,
      is a point which I leave to their merciful consideration: a reading man
      was a title which he never aspired to. He took a very creditable degree in
      due season, and was placed in the fourth class with a man who took up a
      very long list of books, and was supposed to have read himself stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He ought to have done a good deal more," said one of the tutors; "he had
      it in him." "I think he was lucky not to have been plucked, myself," said
      Mr Perkins; "he was a very noisy man."

      "Hallo, Tom! Are you not up yet? Why, man, the judges have gone down to
      the court half an hour ago, escorted by the most ragged regiment of
      ruffians that ever handled a Lochaberaxe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was my matutinal salutation to my friend Thomas Strachan, as I
      entered his room on a splendid spring morning. Tom and I were early
      college allies. We had attended, or rather, to speak more correctly, taken
      out tickets for the different law classes during the same sessions. We had
      fulminated together within the walls of the Juridical Society on legal
      topics which might have broken the heart of Erskine, and rewarded
      ourselves diligently thereafter with the usual relaxations<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2b" id="Page_2b">[Pg 2]</a></span> of a crab
      and a comfortable tumbler. We had aggravated the same grinder with our
      deplorable exposition of the Pandects; and finally assumed, on the same
      day, the full-blown honours of the Advocate's wig and gown. Nor did our
      fraternal parallel end there: for although we had walked the boards of the
      Parliament House with praiseworthy diligence for a couple of sessions,
      neither of us had experienced the dulcet sensation which is communicated
      to the palm by the contact of the first professional guinea. In vain did
      we attempt to insinuate ourselves into the good graces of the agents, and
      coin our intellects into such jocular remarks as are supposed to find most
      favour in the eyes of facetious practitioners. In vain did I carry about
      with me, for a whole week, an artificial process most skilfully made up;
      and in vain did Tom compound and circulate a delectable ditty, entitled
      "The Song of the Multiplepoinding." Not a single solicitor would listen to
      our wooing, or even intrust us with the task of making the simplest
      motion. I believe they thought me too fast, and Tom too much of a genius;
      and, therefore, both of us were left among the ranks of the briefless army
      of the stove. This would not do. Our souls burned within us with a noble
      thirst for legal fame and fees. We held a consultation (without an agent)
      at the Rainbow, and finally determined that since Edinburgh would not hear
      us, Jedburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3b" id="Page_3b">[Pg 3]</a></span>
      should have the privilege of monopolising our maiden eloquence at the
      ensuing justiciary circuit. Jedburgh presents a capital field to the
      ambition of a youthful advocate. Very few counsel go that way; the cases
      are usually trifling, and the juries easily bamboozled. It has besides
      this immense advantage&mdash;that should you by any accident happen to
      break down, nobody will in all probability be the wiser for it, provided
      you have the good sense to ingratiate yourself with the circuit-clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom and I arrived at Jedburgh the afternoon before the circuit began. I
      was not acquainted with a human being within the parliamentary boundaries
      of that respectable borough, and therefore experienced but a slight spasm
      of disappointment when informed by the waiter at the inn, that no
      inquiries had yet been made after me, on the part of writers desirous of
      professional assistance. Strachan had been wiser. Somehow or other, he had
      got a letter of introduction to one Bailie Beerie, a notable civic
      dignitary of the place; and, accordingly, on presenting his credentials,
      was invited by that functionary to dinner, with a hint that he "might
      maybe see a wheen real leddies in the evening." This pointed so plainly to
      a white choker and dress boots, that Strachan durst not take the liberty
      of volunteering the attendance of his friend; and accordingly I had been
      left alone to wile away, as I best might, the tedium of a sluggish
      evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4b" id="Page_4b">[Pg 4]</a></span>
      Before starting, however, Tom pledged himself to return in time for
      supper; as he entertained a painful conviction that the party would be
      excessively slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as it was light, I amused myself pretty well by strolling along
      the banks of the river, and enunciating a splendid speech for the panel in
      an imaginary case of murder. However, before I reached the peroration
      (which was to consist of a vivid picture of the deathbed of a despairing
      jury-man, conscience-stricken by the recollection of an erroneous
      verdict), the shades of evening began to close in; the trouts ceased to
      leap in the pool, and the rooks desisted from their cawing. I returned to
      discuss my solitary mutton at the inn; and then, having nothing to do, sat
      down to a moderate libation, and an odd number of the <i>Temperance
      Magazine</i>, which valuable tract had been left for the reformation of
      the traveller by some peripatetic disciple of Father Mathew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine o'clock came, but so did not Strachan. I began to wax wroth, muttered
      anathemas against my faithless friend, rang for the waiter, and&mdash;having
      ascertained the fact that a Masonic Lodge was that evening engaged in
      celebrating the festival of its peculiar patron&mdash;I set out for the
      purpose of assisting in the pious and mystic labours of the Brethren of
      the Jedburgh St Jeremy. At twelve, when I returned to my quarters,
      escorted by the junior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5b" id="Page_5b">[Pg
      5]</a></span> deacon, I was informed that Strachan had not made his
      appearance, and accordingly I went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I found Tom, as already mentioned, in his couch. There was a
      fine air of negligence in the manner in which his habiliments were
      scattered over the room. One glazed boot lay within the fender, whilst the
      other had been chucked into a coal-scuttle; and there were evident marks
      of mud on the surface of his glossy kerseymeres. Strachan himself looked
      excessively pale, and the sole rejoinder he made to my preliminary remark
      was, a request for soda-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom," said I, inexpressibly shocked at the implied confession of the
      nature of his vespers&mdash;"I wonder you are not ashamed of yourself!
      Have you no higher regard for the dignity of the bar you represent, than
      to expose yourself before a Jedburgh Bailie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dignity be hanged!" replied the incorrigible Strachan. "Bailie Beerie is
      a brick, and I won't hear a word against him. But, O Fred! if you only
      knew what you missed last night! Such a splendid woman&mdash;by Jove, sir,
      a thoroughbred angel. A bust like one of Titian's beauties, and the voice
      of a lovelorn nightingale!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the Misses Beerie, I presume. Come, Tom, I think I can fill up
      your portrait. Hair of the auburn complexion, slightly running into the
      carrot&mdash;skin fair, but freckled&mdash;greenish eyes&mdash;red<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6b" id="Page_6b">[Pg 6]</a></span> elbows&mdash;culpable
      ankles&mdash;elephantine waist&mdash;and sentiments savouring of the
      Secession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ring the bell for the waiter, and hold your impious tongue. You never
      were farther from the mark in your life. The wing of the raven is not more
      glossy than her hair&mdash;and oh, the depth and melting lustre of those
      dark unfathomable eyes! Waiter! a bottle of soda-water, and you may put in
      a thimbleful of cognac."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Tom!&mdash;none of your ravings. Is this an actual Armida, or a new
      freak of your own imagination?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Bonâ fide</i>&mdash;an angel in everything, barring the wings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how the deuce did such a phenomenon happen to emerge at the
      Bailie's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the very question I was asking myself during the whole time of
      dinner. She was clearly not a Scotswoman. When she spoke, it was in the
      sweet low accents of a southern clime; and she waved away the proffered
      haggis with an air of the prettiest disgust!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the Bailie knew her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he did. I got the whole story out of him after dinner, and,
      upon my honour, I think it is the most romantic one I ever heard. About a
      week ago, the lady arrived here without attendants. Some say she came in
      the mail-coach&mdash;others in a dark travelling chariot and pair.
      However, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7b" id="Page_7b">[Pg 7]</a></span>
      matters it? the jewel can derive no lustre or value from the casket!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;but one always likes to have some kind of idea of the setting.
      Get on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She seemed in great distress, and inquired whether there were any letters
      at the post-office addressed to the Honourable Dorothea Percy. No such
      epistle was to be found. She then interrogated the landlord, whether an
      elderly lady, whose appearance she minutely described, had been seen in
      the neighbourhood of Jedburgh; but except old Mrs Slammingham of
      Summertrees, who has been bed-ridden for years, there was nobody in the
      county who at all answered to the description. On hearing this, the lady
      seemed profoundly agitated&mdash;shut herself up in a private parlour, and
      refused all sustenance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had she not a reticule with sandwiches, Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not tempt me to commit justifiable homicide&mdash;you see I am in the
      act of shaving.&mdash;At last the landlady, who is a most respectable
      person, and who felt deeply interested at the desolate situation of the
      poor young lady, ventured to solicit an interview. She was admitted. There
      are moments when the sympathy of even the humblest friend is precious.
      Miss Percy felt grateful for the interest so displayed, and confided the
      tale of her griefs to the matronly bosom of the hostess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she told you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8b" id="Page_8b">[Pg 8]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "No,&mdash;but she told Bailie Beerie. That active magistrate thought it
      his duty to interfere. He waited upon Miss Percy, and from her lips he
      gathered the full particulars of her history. Percy is not her real name,
      but she is the daughter of an English peer of very ancient family. Her
      father having married a second time, Dorothea was exposed to the
      persecutions of a low-minded vulgar woman, whose whole ideas were of that
      mean and mercenary description which characterise the Caucasian race.
      Naomi Shekels was the offspring of a Jew, and she hated, whilst she
      envied, the superior charms of the noble Norman maiden. But she had gained
      an enormous supremacy over the wavering intellect of the elderly Viscount;
      and Dorothea was commanded to receive, with submission, the addresses of a
      loathsome apostate, who had made a prodigious fortune in the railways."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the tribe of Issachar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. A miscreant whose natural function was the vending of cast
      habiliments. Conceive, Fred, what the fair young creature must have felt
      at the bare idea of such shocking spousals! She besought, prayed,
      implored,&mdash;but all in vain. Mammon had taken too deep a root in the
      paternal heart,&mdash;the old coronet had been furbished up by means of
      Israelitish gold, and the father could not see any degradation in forcing
      upon his child an alliance similar to his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9b" id="Page_9b">[Pg 9]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "You interest me excessively."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not a strange tale?" continued Thomas, adjusting a false collar
      round his neck. "I knew you would agree with me when I came to the
      pathetic part. Well, Fred, the altar was decked, the ornaments ready, the
      Rabbi bespoke&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say, Strachan, that Lady Dorothea was to have been married
      after the fashion of the Jews?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know exactly. I think Beerie said it was a Rabbi; but that may
      have been a flight of his own imagination. However, somebody was ready to
      have tied the nuptial knot, and all the joys of existence, and its hopes,
      were about to fade for ever from the vision of my poor Dorothea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Your</i> Dorothea!" cried I in amazement. "Why, Tom&mdash;you don't
      mean to insinuate that you have gone that length already?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I say mine?" repeated Strachan, looking somewhat embarrassed. "It was
      a mere figure of speech: you always take one up so uncommonly short.&mdash;Nothing
      remained for her but flight, or submission to the cruel mandate. Like a
      heroic girl, in whose veins the blood of the old crusaders was bounding,
      she preferred the former alternative. The only relation to whom she could
      apply in so delicate a juncture, was an aged aunt, residing somewhere in
      the north of Scotland. To her she wrote, beseeching her, as she regarded
      the memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10b" id="Page_10b">[Pg 10]</a></span>
      of her buried sister, to receive her miserable child; and she appointed
      this town, Jedburgh, as the place of meeting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where's the aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just the mysterious part of the business. The crisis was so
      imminent that Dorothea could not wait for a reply. She disguised herself,&mdash;packed
      up a few jewels which had been bequeathed to her by her mother,&mdash;and,
      at the dead of night, escaped from her father's mansion. Judge of her
      terror when, on arriving here, panting and perhaps pursued, she could
      obtain no trace whatever of her venerable relative. Alone, inexperienced
      and unfriended, I tremble to think what might have been her fate, had it
      not been for the kind humanity of Beerie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what was the Bailie's line of conduct?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He behaved to her, Fred, like a parent. He supplied her wants, and
      invited her to make his house her home, at least until the aunt should
      appear. But the noble creature would not subject herself to the weight of
      so many obligations. She accepted, indeed, his assistance, but preferred
      remaining here until she could place herself beneath legitimate
      guardianship. And doubtless," continued Strachan with fervour, "her good
      angel is watching over her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is the whole story?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11b" id="Page_11b">[Pg 11]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, Tom, it looks uncommonly like a piece of deliberate humbug!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your ignorance misleads you, Fred. You would not say so had you seen her.
      So sweet&mdash;so gentle&mdash;with such a tinge of melancholy resignation
      in her eye, like that of a virgin martyr about to suffer at the stake! No
      one could look upon her for a moment and doubt her purity and truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps. But you must allow that we are not living exactly in the age of
      romance. An elopement with an officer of dragoons is about the farthest
      extent of legitimate enterprise which is left to a modern damsel; and,
      upon my word, I think the story would have told better, had some such hero
      been inserted as a sort of counterpoise to the Jew. But what's the matter?
      Have you lost anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very odd!" said Strachan, "I am perfectly certain that I had on my
      emerald studs last night. I recollect that Dorothea admired them
      exceedingly. Where on earth can I have put them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, I'm sure. I suspect, Tom, you and the Bailie were rather
      convivial after supper. Is your watch wound up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it is. I assure you you are quite wrong. It was a mere matter
      of four or five tumblers. Very odd this! Why&mdash;I can't find my watch
      neither!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo! what the deuce! Have we fallen into<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_12b" id="Page_12b">[Pg 12]</a></span> a den of thieves? This is
      a nice beginning to our circuit practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could swear, Fred, that I put it below my pillow before I went to
      sleep. I remember, now, that it was some time before I could fit in the
      key. What can have become of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have not left your room since?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, on my word of honour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh&mdash;pooh! Then it can't possibly be gone. Look beneath the
      bolster."
    </p>
    <p>
      But in vain did we search beneath bolster, mattress, and blankets; yea,
      even downwards to the fundamental straw. Not a trace was to be seen of Cox
      Savoury's horizontal lever, jewelled, as Tom pathetically remarked, in
      four special holes, and warranted to go for a year without more than a
      minute's deviation. Neither were the emerald studs, the pride of
      Strachan's heart, forthcoming. Boots, chambermaid, and waiter were
      collectively summoned&mdash;all assisted in the search, and all
      asseverated their own integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are ye sure, sir, that ye brocht them hame?" said the waiter, an acute
      lad, who had served his apprenticeship at a commercial tavern in the
      Gorbals; "Ye was gey an' fou when ye cam in here yestreen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, you rascal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye ken ye wadna gang to bed till ye had anither tumbler."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13b" id="Page_13b">[Pg 13]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk trash! It was the weakest cold-without in the creation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then ye had a sair fecht on politics wi' anither man in the
      coffee-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! I remember now&mdash;the bagman, who is a member of the League! Where
      is the commercial villain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He gaed aff at sax preceesely, this morning, in his gig, to Kelso."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, by the head of Thistlewood!" cried Strachan, frantically, "my
      ticker will be turned into tracts against the Corn-laws!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hoot na!" said the waiter, "I canna think that. He looked an unco
      respectable-like man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No man can be respectable," replied the aristocratic Thomas, "who sports
      such infernal opinions as I heard him utter last night. My poor studs!
      Fred&mdash;they were a gift from Mary Rivers before we quarrelled, and I
      would not have lost them for the universe! Only think of them being
      exposed for sale at a free-trade bazaar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Tom&mdash;they may turn up yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never in this world, except at a pawnbroker's. I could go mad to think
      that my last memorial of Mary is in all probability glittering in the
      unclean shirt of a bagman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you not better apply to the Fiscal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what purpose? Doubtless the scoundrel has driven off to the nearest
      railway, and is triumphantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14b"
      id="Page_14b">[Pg 14]</a></span> counting the mile-posts as he steams to
      his native Leeds. No, Fred. Both watch and studs are gone beyond the hope
      of redemption."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The loss is certainly a serious one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of it: but a thought strikes me. You recollect the edict, <i>nautæ</i>,
      <i>caupones</i>, <i>stabularii</i>? I have not studied the civil law for
      nothing, and am clearly of opinion that in such a case the landlord is
      liable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove! I believe you are right. But it would be as well to turn up Shaw
      and Dunlop for a precedent before you make any row about it. Besides, it
      may be rather difficult to establish that you lost them at the inn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they only refer the matter to my oath, I can easily settle that
      point," replied Strachan. "Besides, now that I think of it, Miss Percy can
      speak to the watch. She asked me what o'clock it was just before we parted
      on the stairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, what! Is the lady in this house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure&mdash;did I not tell you so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Tom&mdash;couldn't you contrive to let one have a peep at this
      angel of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite impossible. She is the shyest creature in the world, and would
      shrink from the sight of a stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear Tom&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do it, I tell you; so it's no use asking me."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15b" id="Page_15b">[Pg 15]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I must say you are abominably selfish. But what on earth are you
      going to do with that red-and-blue Joinville? You can't go down to court
      without a white neckcloth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not going down to court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my good fellow! what on earth is the meaning of this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not going down to court, that's all. I say, Fred, how do I look in
      this sort of thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncommonly like a cock-pheasant in full plumage. But tell me what you
      mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, since you must needs know, I am going up-stairs to breakfast with
      Miss Percy."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Mr Strachan made me a polite bow, and left the apartment. I
      took my solitary way to the court-house, marvelling at the extreme
      rapidity of the effect which is produced by the envenomed darts of Cupid.

    <p>
      On entering the court, I found that the business had commenced. An
      enormous raw-boned fellow, with a shock of the fieriest hair, and hands of
      such dimensions that a mere glimpse of them excited unpleasant sensations
      at your windpipe, was stationed at the bar, to which, from previous
      practice, he had acquired a sort of prescriptive right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "James M'Wilkin, or Wilkinson, or Wilson,"<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_16b" id="Page_16b">[Pg 16]</a></span> said the presiding judge,
      in a tone of disgust which heightened with each successive alias, "attend
      to the indictment which is about to be preferred against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And certainly, if the indictment contained a true statement of the facts,
      James M'Wilkin, or Wilkinson, or Wilson, was about as thoroughpaced a
      marauder as ever perambulated a common. He was charged with sheep-stealing
      and assault; inasmuch as, on a certain night subsequent to the Kelso fair,
      he, the said individual with the plural denominations, did wickedly and
      feloniously steal, uplift, and away take from a field adjoining to the
      Northumberland road, six wethers, the property, or in the lawful
      possession, of Jacob Gubbins, grazier, then and now, or lately, residing
      in Morpeth; and, moreover, on being followed by the said Gubbins, who
      demanded restitution of his property, he, the said M'Wilkin, &amp;c. had,
      in the most brutal manner, struck, knocked down, and lavished divers kicks
      upon the corporality of the Northumbrian bumpkin, to the fracture of three
      of his ribs, and otherwise to the injury of his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the perusal of this formidable document by the clerk, M'Wilkin
      stood scratching his poll, and leering about him as though he considered
      the whole ceremony as a sort of solemn joke. I never in the course of my
      life cast eyes on a more nonchalant or unmitigated ruffian.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17b" id="Page_17b">[Pg 17]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you say, M'Wilkin?" asked the judge; "are you guilty or not
      guilty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not guilty, aff course. D'ye tak me for a fule?" and M'Wilkin flounced
      down upon his seat, as though he had been an ornament to society.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you a counsel?" asked the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "De'il ane&mdash;nor a bawbee," replied the free-booter.

      Acting upon the noble principle of Scottish jurisprudence, that no man
      shall undergo his trial without sufficient legal advice, his lordship in
      the kindest manner asked me to take charge of the fortunes of the forlorn
      M'Wilkin. Of course I made no scruples; for, so long as it was matter of
      practice, I should have felt no hesitation in undertaking the defence of
      Beelzebub. I therefore leaned across the dock, and exchanged a few hurried
      sentences with my first client.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you plead guilty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for? I've been here before. Man, I'm thinking ye're a saft ane!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you not steal the sheep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay&mdash;that's just the question. Let them find that out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the grazier saw you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I blackened his e'es."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be transported to a dead certainty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deevil a fears, if ye're worth the price o' half a mutchkin. I'm saying&mdash;get
      me a Hawick jury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18b" id="Page_18b">[Pg
      18]</a></span> and it's a' richt. They ken me gey and weel thereabouts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I was by no means satisfied in my own mind that an intimate
      acquaintance with M'Wilkin and his previous pursuits would be a strong
      recommendation in his favour to any possible assize, I thought it best to
      follow his instructions, and managed my challenges so well that I secured
      a majority of Hawickers. The jury being sworn in, the cause proceeded; and
      certainly, before three witnesses had been examined, it appeared to me
      beyond all manner of doubt, that, in the language of Tom Campbell, my
      unfortunate client was
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doom'd the long coves of Sydney isle to see,"<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      as a permanent addition to that cultivated and Patagonian population. The
      grazier stood to his story like a man, and all efforts to break him down
      by cross-examination were fruitless. There was also another hawbuck who
      swore to the sheep, and was witness to the assault; so that, in fact, the
      evidence was legally complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst I was occupied in the vain attempt to make Gubbins contradict
      himself, there had been a slight commotion in the court-room. On looking
      round afterwards, I was astonished to behold my friend Strachan seated in
      the Magistrate's box, next to a very pretty and showily-dressed woman, to
      whom he was paying the most marked and deliberate<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_19b" id="Page_19b">[Pg 19]</a></span> attention. On the other
      side of her was an individual in a civic chain, whose fat, pursy,
      apoplectic appearance, and nose of the colour of an Orleans plum,
      thoroughly realised my mental picture of the Bailie. His small, blood-shot
      eyes twinkled with magisterial dignity and importance; and he looked,
      beside Miss Percy&mdash;for I could not doubt that it was she&mdash;like a
      satyr in charge of Florimel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last witness for the crown, a very noted police-officer from Glasgow,
      was then put into the box, to prove a previous conviction against my
      friend M'Wilkin. This man bore a high reputation in his calling, and was,
      indeed, esteemed as a sort of Scottish Vidocq, who knew by headmark every
      filcher of a handkerchief between Caithness and the Border. He met the
      bold broad stare of the prisoner with a kind of nod, as much as to assure
      him that his time was very nearly up; and then deliberately proceeded to
      take a hawk's-eye view of the assembly. I noticed a sort of quiet sneer as
      he glanced at the Magistrate's box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Strachan!" thought I. "His infatuation must indeed be palpable,
      since even a common officer can read his secret in a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      I might just as well have tried to shake Ailsa Craig as to make an
      impression upon this witness; however, heroically devoted to my trust, I
      hazarded the attempt, and ended by bringing out several additional<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20b" id="Page_20b">[Pg 20]</a></span> tales
      of turpitude in the life and times of M'Wilkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make room there in the passage! The lady has fainted," cried the macer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started to my feet, and was just in time to see Miss Percy conveyed from
      the court, in an apparently inanimate state, by the Bailie and the
      agitated Strachan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devilish fine-looking woman that!" observed the Advocate-Depute across
      the table. "Where did your friend Mr Strachan get hold of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really don't know. I say&mdash;are you going to address the jury for
      the crown?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite immaterial. The case is distinctly proved, and I presume you
      don't intend to speak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not so sure of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well,&mdash;in that case I suppose I must say a word or two. This
      closes the evidence for the crown, my lord;" and the Depute began to turn
      over his papers, preparatory to a short harangue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just commenced his speech, when I felt a hand laid upon my
      shoulder. I looked around: Strachan was behind me, pale and almost
      breathless with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fred&mdash;can I depend upon your friendship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you can. What's the row?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ten pounds about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;but what do you mean to do with them?<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_21b" id="Page_21b">[Pg 21]</a></span> Surely you are not going
      to make a blockhead of yourself by bolting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;no! give me the money&mdash;quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On your word of honour, Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my sacred word of honour!&mdash;That's a good fellow&mdash;thank you,
      Fred;" and Strachan pocketed the currency. "Now," said he, "I have just
      one other request to make."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak against time, there's a dear fellow! Spin out the case as long as
      you can, and don't let the jury retire for at least three quarters of an
      hour. I know you can do it better than any other man at the bar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you in earnest, Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most solemnly. My whole future happiness&mdash;nay, perhaps the life of a
      human being depends upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case I think I shall tip them an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven reward you, Fred! I never can forget your kindness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where shall I see you afterwards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the hotel. Now, my dear boy, be sure that you pitch it in, and, if
      possible, get the judge to charge after you. Time's all that's wanted&mdash;adieu!"
      and Tom disappeared in a twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had little leisure to turn over the meaning of this interview in my
      mind, for the address of my learned opponent was very short and pithy. He<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22b" id="Page_22b">[Pg 22]</a></span> merely
      pointed out the clear facts, as substantiated by evidence, and brought
      home to the unhappy M'Wilkin; and concluded by demanding a verdict on both
      charges contained in the indictment against the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you wish to say anything, sir?" said the judge to me, with a kind of
      tone which indicated his hope that I was going to say nothing. Doubtless
      his lordship thought that, as a very young counsel, I would take the hint;
      but he was considerably mistaken in his man. I came to the bar for
      practice&mdash;I went on the circuit with the solemn determination to
      speak in every case, however desperate; and it needed not the admonition
      of Strachan to make me carry my purpose into execution. What did I care
      about occupying the time of the court? His lordship was paid to listen,
      and could very well afford to hear the man who was pleading for M'Wilkin
      without a fee. I must say, however, that he looked somewhat disgusted when
      I rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      A first appearance is a nervous thing, but there is nothing like going
      boldly at your subject. "<i>Fiat experimentum in corpore vili</i>" is a
      capital maxim in the Justiciary Court. The worse your case, the less
      chance you have to spoil it; and I never had a worse than M'Wilkin's.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began by buttering the jury on their evident intelligence and the high
      functions they had to discharge, which of course were magnified to the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23b" id="Page_23b">[Pg 23]</a></span> skies.
      I then went slap-dash at the evidence; and, as I could say nothing in
      favour of my client, directed a tremendous battery of abuse and
      insinuation against his accuser.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who is this Gubbins, gentlemen, that you should believe this most
      incredible, most atrocious, and most clumsy apocrypha of his? I will tell
      you. He is an English butcher&mdash;a dealer in cattle and in bestial&mdash;one
      of those men who derive their whole subsistence from the profits realised
      by the sale of our native Scottish produce. This is the way in which our
      hills are depopulated, and our glens converted into solitudes. It is for
      him and his confederates&mdash;not for us&mdash;that our shepherds watch
      and toil, that our herds and flocks are reared, that the richness of the
      land is absorbed! And who speaks to the character of this Gubbins? You
      have heard the pointless remarks made by my learned friend upon the
      character of my unfortunate client; but he has not dared to adduce in this
      court one single witness in behalf of the character of his witness.
      Gentlemen, he durst not do it! Gubbins has deponed to you that he bought
      those sheep at the fair of Kelso, from a person of the name of Shiells,
      and that he paid the money for them. Where is the evidence of that? Where
      is Shiells to tell us whether he actually sold these sheep, or whether, on
      the contrary, they were not stolen from him? Has it been proved to you,
      gentlemen, that M'Wilkin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24b"
      id="Page_24b">[Pg 24]</a></span> is not a friend of Shiells&mdash;that he
      did not receive notice of the theft&mdash;that he did not pursue the
      robber, and, recognising the stolen property by their mark, seize them for
      the benefit of their owner? No such proof at least has been led upon the
      part of the crown, and in the absence of it, I ask you fearlessly, whether
      you can possibly violate your consciences by returning a verdict of
      guilty? Is it not possible&mdash;nay, is it not extremely probable, that
      Gubbins was the actual thief? Was it not his interest, far more than
      M'Wilkin's, to abstract those poor unhappy sheep, because it is avowedly
      his trade to fill the insatiable maw of the Southron? And in that case,
      who should be at the bar? Gubbins! Gubbins, I say, who this day has the
      unparalleled audacity to appear before an enlightened Scottish jury, and
      to give evidence which, in former times, might have led to the awful
      consequence of the execution of an innocent man! And this is what my
      learned friend calls evidence! Evidence to condemn a fellow-countryman,
      gentlemen? No&mdash;not to condemn a dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus summarily disposed of Gubbins, I turned my artillery against
      the attendant drover and the policeman. The first I indignantly denounced
      as either an accomplice or a tool: the second I smote more severely.
      Policemen are not popular in Hawick; and, knowing this, I contrived to
      blacken the Scottish Vidocq as a bloodhound.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25b" id="Page_25b">[Pg 25]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      But by far the finest flight of fancy in which I indulged was reserved for
      the peroration. I was not quite sure of the effect of my commentary on the
      evidence, and therefore thought it might be advisable to touch upon a
      national law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, gentlemen," said I, "assuming for one moment that all my learned
      friend has said to you is true&mdash;that the sheep really belonged to
      this Gubbins, and were taken from him by M'Wilkin&mdash;let us calmly and
      deliberately consider how far such a proceeding can be construed into a
      crime. What has my unfortunate client done that he should be condemned by
      a jury of his countrymen? What he stands charged with is simply this&mdash;that
      he has prevented an Englishman from driving away the produce of our native
      hills. And is this a crime? It may be so, for aught I know, by statute;
      but sure I am, that in the intention, to which alone you must look, there
      lies a far deeper element of patriotism than of deliberate guilt. Think
      for one moment, gentlemen, of the annals of which we are so proud&mdash;of
      the ballads still chanted in the hall and in the hamlet&mdash;of the
      lonely graves and headstones that are scattered all along the surface of
      the southern muirs. Do not these annals tell us how the princes and the
      nobles of the land were wont to think it neither crime nor degradation to
      march with their retainers across the Borders, and to harry with fire and
      sword the fields of Northumberland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26b"
      id="Page_26b">[Pg 26]</a></span> and Durham? Randolph and the Bruce have
      done it, and yet no one dares to attach the stigma of dishonour to their
      names. Do not our ballads tell how at Lammas-tide,
    </p>
    <p>
      'The doughty Earl of Douglas rade<br /> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into
      England to fetch a prey?'</span><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And who shall venture to impeach the honour of the hero who fell upon the
      field of Otterbourne? Need I remind you of those who have died in their
      country's cause, and whose graves are still made the object of many a
      pious pilgrimage? Need I speak of Flodden, that woeful place, where the
      Flowers of the Forest were left lying in one ghastly heap around their
      king? Ah, gentlemen! have I touched you now? True, it was in the olden
      time that these things were done and celebrated; but remember this, that
      society may change its place, states and empires may rise and be
      consolidated, but patriotism still lives enduring and undying as of yore!
      And who shall dare to say that patriotism was not the motive of M'Wilkin?
      Who shall presume to analyse or to blame the instinct which may have
      driven him to the deed? Call him not a felon&mdash;call him rather a poet;
      for over his kindling imagination fell the mighty shadow of the past. Old
      thoughts, old feelings, old impulses, were burning in his soul. He saw in
      Gubbins, not the grazier, but the lawless spoiler of his country; and he
      rose, as a Borderer should, to vindicate the honour of his<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27b" id="Page_27b">[Pg 27]</a></span> race.
      He may have been mistaken in what he did, but the motive, at least, was
      pure. Honour it then, gentlemen, for it is the same motive which is at all
      times the best safeguard of a nation's independence; and do honour
      likewise to yourselves by pronouncing a unanimous verdict of acquittal in
      favour of the prisoner at the bar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time I had finished this harangue, I was wrought up to such a pitch
      of enthusiasm, that I really considered M'Wilkin in the light of an
      extremely ill-used individual, and the tears stood in my eyes as I
      recapitulated the history of his wrongs. Several of the jury, too, began
      to get extremely excited, and looked as fierce as falcons when I reminded
      them of the field of Flodden. But my hopes were considerably damped when I
      heard the charge of his lordship. With all respect for the eminent senator
      who that day presided on the bench, I think he went rather too far when he
      designated my maiden-effort a rhapsody which could only be excused on
      account of the inexperience of the gentleman who uttered it. Passing from
      that unpleasant style of stricture, he went <i>seriatim</i> over all the
      crimes of M'Wilkin, and very distinctly indicated his opinion that a more
      consummate ruffian had seldom figured in the dock. When he concluded,
      however, there was a good deal of whispering in the jury-box, and at last
      the gentlemen of the assize requested permission to retire.

      "That was a fine flare-up of yours, Freddy," said Anthony Whaup, the only
      other counsel for the prisoners upon the circuit. "You came it rather
      strong, though, in the national line. I don't think our venerable friend
      overhead half likes your ideas of international law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes&mdash;I confess he gave me a tolerable wigging. But what would
      you have me do? I must have said some thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, by Jove, your were perfectly right! I always make a point of speaking
      myself; and I can assure you that you did remarkably well. It was a novel
      view, but decidedly ingenious, and may lead to great results. If that
      fellow gets off, you may rely upon it there will be some bloodshed again
      upon the Border."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a jolly calendar, of course, for next circuit. I say, Anthony,&mdash;how
      many cases have you got?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two thefts with habit and repute, a hamesucken, rather a good forgery,
      and an assault with intent to commit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather&mdash;but poor pay. I haven't sacked more than nine guineas
      altogether. Gad!" continued Anthony, stretching himself, "this is slow
      work. I'd rather by a great deal be rowing on the canal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! here come the jury."

    <p>
      They entered, took their seats, and each man in succession answered to his
      name. I stole a glance at M'Wilkin. He looked as leonine as ever, and kept
      winking perseveringly to the Hawickers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, gentlemen," said the clerk of court, "what is your verdict?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The jury, by a majority, find the charges against the prisoner <span
      class="smcap">not proven</span>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurrah!" shouted M'Wilkin, reckless of all authority. "Hurrah! I say&mdash;you
      counsellor in the wig&mdash;ye shanna want a sheep's head thae three
      years, if there's ane to be had on the Border!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this way I gained my first acquittal.

      I found Strachan in his room with his face buried in the bed-clothes. He
      was kicking his legs as though he suffered under a violent fit of the
      toothache.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Tom, what's the matter? Look up, man! Do you know I've got that
      scoundrel off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, I say? Tom, you dunderhead&mdash;what do you mean by making an ass

    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Strachan raised his head from the coverlet. His eyes were absolutely
      pink, and his cheeks of the tint of a lemon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Fred, Fred!" said he with a series of interjectional gasps, "I am the
      most unfortunate wretch in the universe. All the hopes I had formerly
      cherished are blighted at once in the bud! She is gone, my friend&mdash;gone
      away from me, and, alas! I fear, for ever!"

    <p>
      "The deuce she has! and how?"

    <p>
      "Oh what madness tempted me to lead her to the court?&mdash;what
      infatuation it was to expose those angelic features to the risk of
      recognition! Who that ever saw those dove-like eyes could forget them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no objection to the eyes&mdash;they were really very passable. But
      who twigged her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An emissary of her father's&mdash;that odious miscreant who was giving
      evidence at the trial."

    <p>
      "The policeman? Whew! Tom!&mdash;I don't like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was formerly the land-steward of the Viscount;&mdash;a callous, cruel
      wretch, who was more than suspected of having made away with his wife."

      "And did he recognise her?"

      "Dorothea says that she felt fascinated by the glitter of his cold grey
      eye. A shuddering sensation passed through her frame, just as the poor
      warbler of the woods quivers at the approach of<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_31b" id="Page_31b">[Pg 31]</a></span> the rattle-snake. A dark
      mist gathered before her sight, and she saw no more until she awoke to
      consciousness within my arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very pretty work, truly! And what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In great agitation, she told me that she durst tarry no longer here. She
      was certain that the officer would make it his business to track her, and
      communicate her hiding-place to her family; and she shook with horror when
      she thought of the odious Israelitish bridegroom. 'The caverns of the deep
      green sea&mdash;the high Tarpeian rock&mdash;the Leucadian cliff of
      Sappho,' she said, 'all would be preferable to that! And yet, O Thomas, to
      think that we should have met so suddenly, and that to part for ever!'
      'Pon my soul, Fred, I am the most miserable of created beings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what on earth has become of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone&mdash;and I don't know whither. She would not even apprise the
      Bailie of her departure, lest she might leave some clue for discovery. She
      desired me to see him, to thank him, and to pay him for her,&mdash;all of
      which I promised to do. With one kiss&mdash;one deep, burning, agonised
      kiss&mdash;which I shall carry with me to my grave&mdash;she tore herself
      away, sprang into the postchaise, and in another moment was lost to me for
      ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my ten pounds?" said I, in a tone of considerable emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you have had me think twice," asked<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_32b" id="Page_32b">[Pg 32]</a></span> Strachan indignantly,
      "before I tendered my assistance to a forlorn angel in distress, even
      though she possessed no deeper claims on my sympathy? I thought,
      Frederick, you had more chivalry in your nature. You need not be uneasy
      about that trifle; I shall be in funds some time about Christmas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! I thought it was a P. P. transaction, but no matter. And is this
      all the clue you have got to the future residence of the lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No,&mdash;she is to write me from the nearest post-town. You will see,
      Fred, when the letter arrives, how well worthy she is of my adoration."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have found, by long experience, that it is no use remonstrating with a
      man who is head-over-ears in love. The tender passion affects us
      differently, according to our constitutions. One set of fellows, who are
      generally the pleasantest, seldom get beyond the length of flirtation.
      They are always at it, but constantly changing, and therefore manage to
      get through a tolerable catalogue of attachments before they are finally
      brought to book. Such men are quite able to take care of themselves, and
      require but little admonition. You no doubt hear them now and then abused
      for trifling with the affections of young women&mdash;as if the latter had
      themselves the slightest remorse in playing precisely the same game!&mdash;but
      in most cases such censure is undeserved, for they are quite as much<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33b" id="Page_33b">[Pg 33]</a></span> in
      earnest as their neighbours, so long as the impulse lasts. The true
      explanation is, that they have survived their first passion, and that
      their faith is somewhat shaken in the boyish creed of the absolute
      perfectibility of woman. The great disappointment of life does not make
      them misanthropes&mdash;but it forces them to caution, and to a closer
      appreciation of character than is usually undertaken in the first
      instance. They have become, perhaps, more selfish&mdash;certainly more
      suspicious, and though often on the verge of a proposal, they never commit
      themselves without an extreme degree of deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another set seem designed by nature to be the absolute victims of woman.
      Whenever they fall in love, they do it with an earnestness and an
      obstinacy which is actually appalling. The adored object of their
      affections can twine them round her finger, quarrel with them, cheat them,
      caricature them, or flirt with others, without the least risk of severing
      the triple cord of attachment. They become as tame as poodle-dogs, will
      submit patiently to any manner of cruelty or caprice, and in fact seem
      rather to be grateful for such treatment than otherwise. Clever women
      usually contrive to secure a captive of this kind. He is useful to them in
      a hundred ways, never interferes with their schemes, and, if the worst
      comes to the worst, they can always fall back upon him as a <i>pis-aller</i>.

      My friend Tom Strachan belonged decidedly to this latter section. Mary
      Rivers, a remarkably clever and very showy girl, but as arrant a flirt as
      ever wore rosebud in her bosom, had engrossed the whole of his heart
      before he reached the reflecting age of twenty, and kept him for nearly
      five years in a state of uncomplaining bondage. Not that I believe she
      ever cared about him. Tom was as poor as a church-mouse, and had nothing
      on earth to look to except the fruits of his professional industry, which,
      judging from all appearances, would be a long time indeed in ripening.
      Mary was not the sort of person to put up with love in a cottage, even had
      Tom's circumstances been adequate to defray the rent of a tenement of that
      description: she had a vivid appreciation, not only of the substantials
      but of the higher luxuries of existence. But her vanity was flattered at
      having in her train at least one devoted dangler, whom she could play off,
      whenever opportunity required, against some more valuable admirer.
      Besides, Strachan was a man of family, tall, good-looking, and
      unquestionably clever in his way: he also danced the polka well, and was
      useful in the ball-room or the picnic. So Mary Rivers kept him on in a
      kind of blissful dream, just sunning him sufficiently with her smiles to
      make him believe that he was beloved, but never allowing matters to go so
      far as to lead to the report that they were engaged. Tom asked<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35b" id="Page_35b">[Pg 35]</a></span> for
      nothing more. He was quite contented to indulge for years in a dream of
      future bliss, and wrote during the interval a great many more sonnets than
      summonses. Unfortunately sonnets don't pay well, so that his worldly
      affairs did not progress at any remarkable ratio. And he only awoke to a
      sense of his real situation, when Miss Rivers, having picked a quarrel
      with him one day in the Zoological Gardens, announced on the next to her
      friends that she had accepted the hand of a bilious East India merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom made an awful row about it&mdash;grew as attenuated and brown as an
      eel&mdash;and garnished his conversation with several significant hints
      about suicide. He was, however, saved from that ghastly alternative by
      being drafted into a Rowing Club, who plied their gondolas daily on the
      Union Canal. Hard exercise, beer, and pulling had their usual sanatory
      effect, and Tom gradually recovered his health, if not his spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this very crisis that he fell in with this mysterious Miss
      Percy. There was an immense hole in his affections which required to be
      filled up; and, as nature abhors a vacuum, he plugged it with the image of
      Dorothea. The flight, therefore, of the fair levanter, after so brief an
      intercourse, was quite enough to upset him. He was in the situation of a
      man who is informed over-night that he has succeeded to a large fortune,
      and who gets a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36b" id="Page_36b">[Pg
      36]</a></span> next morning explaining that it is a mere mistake. I was
      therefore not at all astonished either at his paroxysms or his credulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had rather a dreary dinner that day. The judges always entertain the
      first day of circuit, and it is considered matter of etiquette that the
      counsel should attend. Sometimes these forensic feeds are pleasant enough;
      but on the present occasion there was a visible damp thrown over the
      spirits of the party. His lordship was evidently savage at the unforeseen
      escape of M'Wilkin, and looked upon me, as I thought, with somewhat of a
      prejudiced eye. Bailie Beerie and the other magistrates seemed uneasy at
      their unusual proximity to a personage who had the power of death and
      transportation, and therefore abstained from emitting the accustomed
      torrent of civic facetiousness. One of the sheriffs wanted to be off on a
      cruise, and another was unwell with the gout. The Depute Advocate was
      fagged; Whaup surly as a bear with a sore ear, on account of the tenuity
      of his fees; and Strachan, of course, in an extremely unconversational
      mood. So I had nothing for it but to eat and drink as plentifully as I
      could, and very thankful I was that the claret was tolerably sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rose from table early. As I did not like to leave Tom to himself in his
      present state of mind, we adjourned to his room for the purpose of
      enjoying a cigar; and there, sure enough, upon the table<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37b" id="Page_37b">[Pg 37]</a></span> lay
      the expected missive. Strachan dashed at it like a pike pouncing upon a
      parr; I lay down upon the sofa, lit my weed, and amused myself by watching
      his physiognomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear suffering angel!" said Tom at last, with a sort of whimper, "Destiny
      has done its worst! We have parted, and the first fond dream of our love
      has vanished before the cold and dreary dawn of reality! O my friend&mdash;we
      were like the two birds in the Oriental fable, each doomed to traverse the
      world before we could encounter our mate&mdash;we met, and almost in the
      same hour the thunderbolt burst above us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;two very nice birds," said I. "But what does she say in the
      letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may read it," replied Tom, and he handed me the epistle. It was
      rather a superior specimen of penmanship, and I don't choose to criticise
      the style. Its tenor was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="blockquot">
      "I am hardly yet, my dear friend, capable of estimating the true extent of
      my emotions. Like the buoyant seaweed torn from its native bed among the
      submarine forest of the corals, I have been tossed from wave to wave,
      hurried onwards by a stream more resistless than that which sweeps through
      the Gulf of Labrador, and far&mdash;far away as yet is the wished-for
      haven of my rest. Hitherto my life has been a tissue of calamity and woe.
      Over my head <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38b" id="Page_38b">[Pg 38]</a></span>since
      childhood, has stretched a dull and dreary canopy of clouds, shutting me
      out for ever from a glimpse of the blessed sun. Once, and but once only
      have I seen a chasm in that envious veil&mdash;only once and for a few, a
      <i>very</i> few moments, have I gazed upon the blue empyrean, and felt my
      heart expand and thrill to the glories of its liquid lustre. That once&mdash;oh,
      Mr Strachan, can I ever forget it?&mdash;that once comprises the era of
      the few hours which were the silent witnesses of our meeting!
    </p>
    <p class="blockquot">
      "Am I weak in writing to you thus? Perhaps I am; but then, Thomas, I have
      never been taught to dissemble. Did I, however, think it probable that we
      should ever meet again&mdash;that I should hear from your lips a
      repetition of that language which now is chronicled in my soul&mdash;it
      may be that I would not have dared to risk an avowal so candid and so
      dear! As it is, it matters not. You have been my benefactor, my kind
      consoler&mdash;my friend. You have told me that you love; and in the
      fulness and native simplicity of my heart, I believe you. And if it be any
      satisfaction to you to know that your sentiments have been at least
      appreciated, believe that of all the pangs which the poor Dorothea has
      suffered, this last agony of parting has been incomparably the most
      severe.
    </p>
    <p class="blockquot">
      "You asked me if there was no hope. Oh, my Thomas! what would I not give
      could I venture to answer, yes? But it cannot be! You are young <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39b" id="Page_39b">[Pg 39]</a></span>and
      happy, and will yet be fortunate and beloved: why, then, should I permit
      so fair an existence to be blighted by the upas-tree of destiny under
      which I am doomed to languish? You shall not say that I am selfish&mdash;you
      shall not hereafter reproach me for having permitted you to share a burden
      too great for both of us to carry. You must learn the one great lesson of
      existence, to submit and to forget!
    </p>
    <p class="blockquot">
      "I am going far away, to the margin of that inhospitable shore which
      receives upon its rocks the billows of the unbroken Atlantic&mdash;or
      haply, amongst the remoter isles, I shall listen to the sea-mew's cry. Do
      not weep for me. Amidst the myriad of bright and glowing things which
      flutter over the surface of this green creation, let one feeble, choking,
      overburdened heart be forgotten! Follow me not&mdash;seek me not&mdash;for,
      like the mermaid on the approach of the mariner, I should shrink from the
      face of man into the glassy caverns of the deep.
    </p>
    <p class="blockquot">
      "Adieu, Thomas, adieu! Say what you will for me to the noble and generous
      Beerie. Would to heaven that I could send him some token in return for all
      his kindness! But a good and gallant heart is its own most adequate
      reward.

    <p class="blockquot">
      "They are putting to the horses&mdash;I can hear the rumble of the
      chariot! Oh, once more, dear friend&mdash;alas, too inexpressibly dear!&mdash;take
      my last farewell. Adieu&mdash;my heart is breaking as I write the bitter
      word!&mdash;forget me."

    <p>
      "Do you wonder at my sorrow now?" said Strachan, as I laid down the
      passionate epistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no. It is well got up upon the whole, and does credit to the lady's
      erudition. But I don't see why she should insist so strongly upon eternal
      separation. Have you no idea whereabouts that aunt of hers may happen to
      reside?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the slightest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, judging from her letter, it must be somewhere about Benbecula or
      Tiree. I shouldn't even wonder if she had a summer box on St Kilda."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right! I did not think of that&mdash;you observe she speaks of the
      remoter isles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, and for half a century there has not been a mermaid seen to
      the east of the Lewis. Now, take my advice, Tom&mdash;don't make a fool of
      yourself in the meantime, but wait until the Court of Session rises in
      July. That will allow plenty of time for matters to settle; and if the old
      Viscount and that abominable Abiram don't find her out before then, you
      may depend upon it they will abandon the search. In the interim, the lady
      will have cooled. Walks upon the sea-shore are uncommonly dull without
      something like reciprocal sentimentality. The odds are, that the old aunt
      is addicted to snuff, tracts, and the distribution of flannel, and before
      August, the fair Dorothea will be yearning for a sight of her adorer. You
      can easily gammon Anthony Whaup into a loan of that yacht of his which<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41b" id="Page_41b">[Pg 41]</a></span> he
      makes such a boast of; and if you go prudently about it, and flatter him
      on the score of his steering, I haven't the least doubt that he will
      victual his hooker and give you a cruise in it for nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirable, my dear Fred! We shall touch at all the isles from Iona to
      Uist; and if Miss Percy be indeed there&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can carry her off on five minutes' notice, and our long friend will
      be abundantly delighted. Only, mind this! If you want my candid opinion on
      the wisdom of such an alliance, I should strongly recommend you to meddle
      no farther in the matter, for I have my doubts about the Honourable
      Dorothea, and&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah, Fred! Doubts after such a letter as that? Impossible! No, my dear
      friend&mdash;your scheme is admirable&mdash;unexceptionable, and I shall
      certainly act upon it. But oh&mdash;it is a weary time till July!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Merely a short interval of green pease and strawberries. I advise you,
      however, to fix down Whaup as early as you can for the cruise."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hint was rapidly taken. We sent for our facetious friend, ordered
      supper, and in the course of a couple of tumblers, persuaded him that his
      knowledge of nautical affairs was not exceeded by that of T. P. Cooke, and
      that he was much deeper versed in the mysteries of sky-scraping than
      Fenimore Cooper. Whaup gave in. By dint of a little extra persuasion, I
      believe we might have coaxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42b"
      id="Page_42b">[Pg 42]</a></span> him into a voyage for Otaheite; and
      before we parted for the evening it was agreed that Strachan should hold
      himself in readiness to start for the Western Islands about the latter end
      of July&mdash;Whaup being responsible for the provisions and champagne,
      whilst Tom pledged himself to cigars.

      I never ascertained the exact amount of the sum which Tom handed over to
      the Bailie. It must, however, have been considerable, for he took to
      retrenching his expenditure, and never once dropped a hint about the ten
      pounds which I was so singularly verdant as to lend him. The summer
      session stole away as quickly as its predecessors, though not, in so far
      as I was concerned, quite as unprofitably, for I got a couple of
      Sheriff-court papers to draw in consequence of my M'Wilkin appearance.
      Tom, however, was very low about himself, and affected solitude. He would
      not join in any of the strawberry lunches or fish dinners so attractive to
      the junior members of the bar; but frequented the Botanical Gardens, where
      he might be seen any fine afternoon, stretched upon the bank beside the
      pond, concocting sonnets, or inscribing the name of Dorothea upon the
      monument dedicated to Linnæus.

    <p>
      Time, however, stole on. The last man who was going to be married got his
      valedictory dinner at the close of the session. Gowns were thrown off,
      wigs boxed up, and we all dispersed to the country wheresoever our
      inclination might lead us. I resolved to devote the earlier part of the
      vacation to the discovery of the town of Clackmannan&mdash;a place of
      which I had often heard, but which no human being whom I ever encountered
      had seen. Whaup was not oblivious of his promise, and Strachan clove unto
      him like a limpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not meet again until September was well-nigh over. In common with
      Strachan, I had adopted the resolution of changing my circuit, and
      henceforth adhering to Glasgow, which, from its superior supply of
      criminals, is the favourite resort of our young forensic aspirants. So I
      packed my portmanteau, invoked the assistance of Saint Rollox, and started
      for the balmy west.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first man I met in George's Square was my own delightful Thomas. He
      looked rather thin; was fearfully sun-burned; had on a pair of canvass
      trousers most wofully bespattered with tar, and evidently had not shaved
      for a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Tom, my dear fellow!" cried I, "can this possibly be you? What the
      deuce have you been doing with yourself? You look as hairy as Robinson
      Crusoe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should see Whaup,&mdash;he's rather worse off<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_44b" id="Page_44b">[Pg 44]</a></span> than Friday. We have just
      landed at the Broomielaw, but I was obliged to leave Anthony in a tavern
      for fear we should be mobbed in the street. I'm off by the rail to
      Edinburgh, to get some decent toggery for us both. Lend me a pound-note,
      will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly&mdash;that's eleven, you recollect. But what's the meaning of
      all this? Where is the yacht?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Safe&mdash;under twenty fathoms of dark blue water, at a place they call
      the Sneeshanish Islands. Catch me going out again, with Anthony as
      steersman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt he is an odd sort of Palinurus. But when did this happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten days ago. We were three days and nights upon the rock, with nothing
      to eat except two biscuits, raw mussels and tangle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy on us! and how did you get off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a kelp-boat from Harris. But I haven't time for explanation just now.
      Go down, like a good fellow, to the Broomielaw, No. 431&mdash;you will
      find Anthony enjoying himself with beef steaks and bottled stout, in the
      back parlour of the Cat and Bagpipes. I must refer you to him for the
      details."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word more&mdash;you'll be back to the circuit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Decidedly. To-morrow morning: as soon as I can get my things together."

    </p>
    <p>
      "And the lady&mdash;what news of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The countenance of Strachan fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear friend! I wish you had not touched upon that string&mdash;you
      have set my whole frame a-jarring. No trace of her&mdash;none&mdash;none!
      I fear I shall never see her more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come! don't be down-hearted. One never can tell what may happen. Perhaps
      you may meet her sooner than you think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a kind-hearted fellow, Fred. But I've lost all hope. Nothing but
      a dreary existence is now before me, and&mdash;but, by Jupiter, there goes
      the starting bell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom vanished, like Aubrey's apparition, with a melodious twang, and a
      perceptible odour of tar; and so, being determined to expiscate the
      matter, I proceeded towards the Broomielaw, and in due time became master
      of the locality of the Cat and Bagpipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there a Mr Whaup here?" I inquired of Mrs M'Tavish, the landlady, who
      was filling a gill-stoup at the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here you are, old chap!" cried the hilarious voice of Anthony from an
      inner apartment. "Turn to the right, steer clear of the scrubbing brushes,
      and help yourself to a mouthful of Guinness."
    </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed. Heavens, what a figure he was! His trousers were rent both at
      the knees and elsewhere, and were kept together solely by means of<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46b" id="Page_46b">[Pg 46]</a></span>
      whip-cord. His shirt had evidently not benefited by the removal of the
      excise duties upon soap, and was screened from the scrutiny of the
      beholder by an extempore paletot, fabricated out of sail-cloth, without
      the remotest apology for sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony, however, looked well in health, and appeared to be in tremendous
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tip us your fin, my old coxs'un!" said he, winking at me over the rim of
      an enormous pewter vessel which effectually eclipsed the lower segment of
      his visage. "Blessed if I ain't as glad to see you as one of Mother
      Carey's chickens in a squall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Anthony! leave off your nautical nonsense, and talk like a man of
      the world. What on earth have you and Tom Strachan been after?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing on earth, but a good deal on sea, and a trifle on as
      uncomfortable a section of basalt as ever served two unhappy buccaniers
      for bed, table, and sofa. The chillness is not off me yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how did it happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very simply: but I'll tell you all about it. It's a long story, though,
      so if you please I shall top off with something hot. I'm glad you've come,
      however, for I had some doubts how far this sort of original Petersham
      would inspire confidence as to my credit in the bosom of the fair
      M'Tavish. It's all right now, however, so here goes for my yarn."
    </p>
    <p>
      But I shall not follow my friend through all the<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_47b" id="Page_47b">[Pg 47]</a></span> windings of his
      discourse, varied though it certainly was, like the adventures of the
      venerated Sinbad. Suffice it to say, that they were hardly out of sight of
      the Cumbraes before Tom confided the whole tale of his sorrows to the
      callous Anthony, who, as he expressed it, had come out for a lark, and had
      no idea of rummaging the whole of the west coast and the adjacent islands
      for a petticoat. Moved, however, by the pathetic entreaties of Strachan,
      and, perhaps, somewhat reconciled to the quest by the dim vision of an
      elopement, Anthony magnanimously waived his objections, and the two kept
      cruising together in a little shell of a yacht, all round the western
      Archipelago. Besides themselves, there were only a man and a boy on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was slow work," said Anthony,&mdash;"deucedly slow. I would not have
      minded the thing so much if Strachan had been reasonably sociable; but it
      was rather irksome, you will allow, when, after the boy had brought in the
      kettle, and we had made everything snug for the night, Master Strachan
      began to maunder about the lady's eyes, and to tear his hair, and to call
      himself the most miserable dog in existence. I had serious thoughts, at
      one time, of leaving him ashore on Mull or Skye, and making off direct to
      the Orkneys; but good-nature was always my foible, so I went on, beating
      from one place to another, as though we had been looking for the wreck of
      the Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48b" id="Page_48b">[Pg 48]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll never take another cruise with a lover so long as I live. Tom led me
      all manner of dances, and we were twice fired at from farm-houses where he
      was caterwauling beneath the windows with a guitar. It seems he had heard
      that flame of his sing a Spanish air at Jedburgh. Tom must needs pick it
      up, and you have no idea how he pestered me. Go where we would, he kept
      harping on that abominable ditty, in the hope that his mistress might hear
      him; and, when I remonstrated on the absurdity of the proceeding, he
      quoted the case of Blondel, and some trash out of Uhland's ballads.
      Serenading on the west coast is by no means a pleasant pastime. The nights
      are as raw as an anchovy, and the midges particularly plentiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, we could find no trace of the lady after all. Strachan got
      into low spirits, and I confess that I was sometimes sulky&mdash;so we had
      an occasional blow-up, which by no means added to the conviviality of the
      voyage. One evening, just at sundown, we entered the Sound of Sneeshanish&mdash;an
      ugly place, let me tell you, at the best, but especially to be avoided in
      any thing like a gale of wind. The clouds in the horizon looked
      particularly threatening, and I got a little anxious, for I knew that
      there were some rocks about, and not a lighthouse in the whole of the
      district.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In an hour or two it grew as dark as a wolf's throat. I could not for the
      life of me make out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49b" id="Page_49b">[Pg
      49]</a></span> where we were, for the Sound is very narrow in some parts,
      and occasionally I thought that I could hear breakers ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tom,' said I, 'Tom, you lubber!&mdash;for our esteemed friend was, as
      usual, lying on the deck, with a cigar in his mouth, twangling at that
      eternal guitar&mdash;'take hold of the helm, will you, for a minute, while
      I go down and look at the chart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was as cold as a cucumber; so, after having ascertained, as I best
      could, the bearings about the Sound, I rather think I <i>did</i> stop
      below for one moment&mdash;but not longer&mdash;just to mix a glass of
      swizzle by way of fortification, for I didn't expect to get to bed that
      night. All of a sudden I heard a shout from the bows, bolted upon deck,
      and there, sure enough, was a black object right ahead, with the surf
      shooting over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Luff, Tom! or we are all dead men;&mdash;Luff, I say!' shouted I. I
      might as well have called to a millstone. Tom was in a kind of trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'O Dorothea!' said our friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'To the devil with Dorothea!' roared I, snatching the tiller from his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It was too late. We went smash upon the rock, with a force that sent us
      headlong upon the deck, and Strachan staggered to his feet, bleeding
      profusely at the proboscis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down came the sail rattling about our ears, and over lurched the yacht. I
      saw there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50b" id="Page_50b">[Pg
      50]</a></span> time to lose, so I leaped at once upon the rock, and called
      upon the rest to follow me. They did so, and were lucky to escape with no
      more disaster than a ruffling of the cuticle on the basalt; for in two
      minutes more all was over. Some of the timbers had been staved in at the
      first concussion. She rapidly filled,&mdash;and down went, before my eyes,
      the Caption, the tidiest little craft that ever pitched her broadside into
      the hull of a Frenchman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well told indeed," said I, "only, Anthony, it does strike me that
      the last paragraph is not quite original. I've heard something like it in
      my younger days, at the Adelphi. But what became of you afterwards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, we were in a fix, as you may easily conceive. All we could do was
      to scramble up the rocks,&mdash;which, fortunately, were not too
      precipitous,&mdash;until we reached a dry place, where we lay, huddled
      together, until morning. When light came, we found that we were not on the
      main land, but on a kind of little stack in the very centre of the
      channel, without a blade of grass upon it, or the prospect of a sail in
      sight. This was a nice situation for two members of the Scottish bar! The
      first thing we did was to inquire into the state of provisions, which we
      found to consist of a couple of biscuits, that little Jim, the boy,
      happened to have about him. Of course we followed the example of the
      earlier navigators, and confiscated these<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_51b" id="Page_51b">[Pg 51]</a></span> <i>pro bono publico</i>.
      We had not a drop of alcohol among us, but, very luckily, picked up a
      small keg of fresh water, which, I believe, was our salvation. Strachan
      did not behave well. He wanted to keep half-a-dozen cigars to himself; but
      such monstrous selfishness could not be permitted, and the rest of us took
      them from him by force. I shall always blame myself for having weakly
      restored to him a cheroot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what followed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, we remained three days upon the rock. Fortunately the weather was
      moderate, so that we were not absolutely washed away, but for all that it
      was consumedly cold of nights. The worst thing, however, was the
      deplorable state of our larder. We finished the biscuits the first day,
      trusting to be speedily relieved; but the sun set without a vestige of a
      sail, and we supped sparingly upon tangle. Next morning we were so
      ravenous that we could have eaten raw squirrels. That day we subsisted
      entirely upon shell-fish, and smoked out all our cigars. On the third we
      bolted two old gloves, buttons and all; and, do you know, Fred, I began to
      be seriously alarmed about the boy Jim, for Strachan kept eyeing him like
      an ogre, began to mutter some horrid suggestions as to the propriety of
      casting lots, and execrated his own stupidity in being unprovided with a
      jar of pickles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Anthony&mdash;for shame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52b" id="Page_52b">[Pg 52]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;I'm sure he was thinking about it, if he did not say so.
      However, we lunched upon a shoe, and for my own part, whenever I go upon
      another voyage, I shall take the precaution of providing myself with
      pliable French boots&mdash;your Kilmarnock leather is so very intolerably
      tough! Towards evening, to our infinite joy, we descried a boat entering
      the Sound. We shouted, as you may be sure, like demons. The Celtic
      Samaritans came up, and, thanks to the kindness of Rory M'Gregor the
      master, we each of us went to sleep that night with at least two gallons
      of oatmeal porridge comfortably stowed beneath our belts. And that's the
      whole history."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how do you feel after such unexampled privation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a hair the worse. But this I know, that if ever I am caught again on
      such idiotical errand as hunting for a young woman through the Highlands,
      my nearest of kin are at perfect liberty to have me cognosced without
      opposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;you are no lover, Anthony. Strachan, now, would go barefooted
      through Stony Arabia for the mere chance of a casual glimpse at his
      mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I can say, my dear fellow, is, that if connubial happiness cannot be
      purchased without a month's twangling on a guitar and three consecutive
      suppers upon seaweed, I know at least one respectable young barrister who
      is likely to die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53b" id="Page_53b">[Pg
      53]</a></span> unmarried. But I say, Fred, let us have a coach and drive
      up to your hotel. You can lend me a coat, I suppose, or something of the
      sort, until Strachan arrives; and just be good enough, will you, to settle
      with Mrs M'Tavish for the bill, for, by all my hopes of a sheriffship, I
      have been thoroughly purged of my tin."
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter may not be of any especial interest to the public; at the same
      time I think it right to record the fact that Anthony Whaup owes me seven
      shillings and eightpence unto this day.

    <p>
      "That is all I can tell you about it," said Mr Hedger, as he handed me the
      last of three indictments, with the joyful accompaniment of the fees.
      "That is all I can tell you about it. If the <i>alibi</i> will hold water,
      good and well&mdash;if not, M'Closkie will be transported."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedger is the very best criminal agent I ever met with. There is always a
      point in his cases&mdash;his precognitions are perfect, and pleading,
      under such auspices, becomes a kind of realised romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way," said he, "is there a Mr Strachan of your bar at circuit? I
      have a curious communication from a prisoner who is desirous to have him
      as her counsel."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54b" id="Page_54b">[Pg 54]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! I am glad to hear it. Mr Strachan is a particular friend of mine,
      and will be here immediately. I shall be glad to introduce you. Is it a
      heavy case?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but rather an odd one&mdash;a theft of money committed at the
      Blenheim hotel. The woman seems a person of education, but, as she
      obstinately refuses to tell me her story, I know very little more about it
      than is contained in the face of the indictment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is her name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why you know that is a matter not very easily ascertained. She called
      herself Euphemia Saville when brought up for examination, and of course
      she will be tried as such. She is well dressed, and rather pretty, but she
      won't have any other counsel than Mr Strachan; and singularly enough, she
      has positively forbidden me to send him a fee on the ground that he would
      take it as an insult."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should feel particularly obliged if the whole public would take to
      insulting me perpetually in that manner! But really this is an odd
      history. Do you think she is acquainted with my friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedger winked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say," said he, "for, to tell you the truth, I know nothing
      earthly about it. Only she was so extremely desirous to have him engaged,
      that I thought it not a little remarkable. I hope your<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_55b" id="Page_55b">[Pg 55]</a></span> friend won't take offence
      if I mention what the woman said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the least, you may be sure of that. And, <i>apropos</i>, here he
      comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      And in effect Whaup and Strachan now walked into the counsel's apartment,
      demure, shaven, and well dressed&mdash;altogether two very
      different-looking individuals from the tatterdemalions of yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Fred," cried Whaup; "Servant, Mr Hedger&mdash;lots of work
      going, eh? Are the pleas nearly over yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very nearly, I believe, Mr Whaup. Would you have the kindness to&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly," said I. "Strachan, allow me to introduce my friend Mr
      Hedger, who is desirous of your professional advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Freddy," said Whaup, looking sulkily at the twain as they retired
      to a window to consult, "what's in the wind now? Has old Hedger got a
      spite at any of his clients?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should I know? What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I should rather think," said Anthony, "that in our friend
      Strachan's hands the lad runs a remarkably good chance of a sea voyage to
      the colonies, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fie for shame, Anthony! You should not bear malice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more I do&mdash;but I can't forget the loss of<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_56b" id="Page_56b">[Pg 56]</a></span> the little Caption all
      through his stupid blundering; and this morning he must needs sleep so
      long that he lost the early train, and has very likely cut me out of
      business for the sheer want of a pair of reputable trousers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind&mdash;there is a good time coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which means, I suppose, that you have got the pick of the cases? Very
      well: it can't be helped, so I shall even show myself in court by way of
      public advertisement."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, my long friend wrestled himself into his gown, adjusted his wig
      knowingly upon his cranium, and rushed toward the court-room as vehemently
      as though the weal of the whole criminal population of the west depended
      upon his individual exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Freddy, come here, if you please," said Strachan, "this is a very
      extraordinary circumstance! Do you know that this woman, Euphemia Saville,
      though she wishes me to act as her counsel, has positively refused to see
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very odd, certainly! Do you know her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard of the name in my life. Are you sure, Mr Hedger, that there
      is no mistake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure, sir. She gave me, in fact, a minute description of your
      person, which perhaps I may be excused from repeating."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I understand," said Tom, fishingly; "complimentary, I suppose&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57b" id="Page_57b">[Pg 57]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why yes, rather so," replied Hedger hesitatingly; and he cast at the same
      time a glance at the limbs of my beloved friend, which convinced me that
      Miss Saville's communication had, somehow or other, borne reference to the
      shape of a parenthesis. "But, at all events, you may be sure she has seen
      you. I really can imagine no reason for an interview. We often have people
      who take the same kind of whims, and you have no idea of their obstinacy.
      The best way will be to let the Crown lead its evidence, and trust
      entirely to cross-examination. I shall take care, at all events, that her
      appearance shall not damage her. She is well dressed, and I don't doubt
      will make use of her cambric handkerchief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a very useful thing that same cambric is," observed I. "Come, Tom, my
      boy, pluck up courage! You have opportunity now for a grand display; and
      if you can poke in something about chivalry and undefended loveliness, you
      may be sure it will have an effect on the jury. There is a strong spice of
      romance in the composition of the men of the Middle Ward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole thing, however, seems to me most mysterious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very; but that is surely an additional charm. We seldom find a chapter
      from the Mysteries of Udolfo transferred to the records of the Justiciary
      Court of Scotland."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58b" id="Page_58b">[Pg 58]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I suppose it must be so. Fred, will you sit beside me at the
      trial? I'm not used to this sort of thing as yet, and I possibly may feel
      nervous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit of you. At any rate I shall be there, and of course you may
      command me."
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time the case was called. Miss Euphemia Saville ascended the trap
      stair, and took her seat between a pair of policemen with exceedingly
      luxuriant whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must allow that I felt a strong curiosity about Euphemia. Her name was
      peculiar; the circumstances under which she came forward were unusual; and
      her predilection for Strachan was tantalising. Her appearance, however,
      did little to solve the mystery. She was neatly, even elegantly dressed in
      black, with a close-fitting bonnet and thick veil, which at first
      effectually obscured her countenance. This, indeed, she partially removed
      when called upon to plead to the indictment; but the law of no civilised
      country that I know of is so savage as to prohibit the use of a
      handkerchief, and the fair Saville availed herself of the privilege by
      burying her countenance in cambric. I could only get a glimpse of some
      beautiful black braided hair and a forehead that resembled alabaster. To
      all appearance she was extremely agitated, and sobbed as she answered to
      the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tender-hearted Strachan was not the sort of<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_59b" id="Page_59b">[Pg 59]</a></span> man to behold the sorrows
      of his client without emotion. In behalf of the junior members of the
      Scottish bar I will say this, that they invariably fight tooth and nail
      when a pretty girl is concerned, and I have frequently heard bursts of
      impassioned eloquence poured forth in defence of a pair of bright eyes or
      a piquant figure, in cases where an elderly or wizened dame would have run
      a strong chance of finding no Cicero by her side. Tom accordingly
      approached the bar for the purpose of putting some questions to his
      client, but not a word could he extract in reply. Euphemia drew down her
      veil, and waved her hand with a repulsive gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what to make of her," said Strachan; "only she seems to be a
      monstrous fine woman. It is clear, however, that she has mistaken me for
      somebody else. I never saw her in my life before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hedger deserves great credit for the way he has got her up. Observe, Tom,
      there is no finery about her; no ribbons or gaudy scarfs, which are as
      unsuitable at a trial as at a funeral. Black is your only wear to find
      favour in the eyes of a jury."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True. It is a pity that so little attention is paid to the æsthetics of
      criminal clothing. But here comes the first witness&mdash;Grobey, I think,
      they call him&mdash;the fellow who lost the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Grobey mounted the witness-box like a cow ascending a staircase. He was
      a huge, elephantine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60b" id="Page_60b">[Pg
      60]</a></span> animal of some sixteen stone, with bushy eyebrows and a
      bald pate, which he ever and anon affectionately caressed with a red and
      yellow bandana. Strachan started at the sound of his voice, surveyed him
      wistfully for a moment, and then said to me in a hurried whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I live, Fred, that is the identical bagman who boned my emerald studs
      at Jedburgh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to say it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fact, upon my honour! There is no mistaking his globular freetrading
      nose. Would it not be possible to object to his evidence on that ground?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy on us! no.&mdash;Reflect&mdash;there is no conviction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True. But he stole them nevertheless. I'll ask him about them when I
      cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Grobey's narrative, however, as embraced in an animated dialogue with
      the public prosecutor, threw some new and unexpected light upon the
      matter. Grobey was a traveller in the employment of the noted house of
      Barnacles, Deadeye, and Company, and perambulated the country for the
      benevolent purpose of administering to deficiency of vision. In the course
      of his wanderings he had arrived at the Blenheim, where, after a light
      supper of fresh herrings, toasted cheese, and Edinburgh ale, assisted, <i>more
      Bagmannorum</i>, by several glasses of stiff brandy-and-water, he had
      retired to his apartment to sleep off the labours of the day.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61b" id="Page_61b">[Pg 61]</a></span>
      Somnus, however, did not descend that night with his usual lightness upon
      Grobey. On the contrary, the deity seemed changed into a ponderous weight,
      which lay heavily upon the chest of the moaning and suffocated traveller;
      and notwithstanding a paralysis which appeared to have seized upon his
      limbs, every external object in the apartment became visible to him as by
      the light of a magic lantern. He heard his watch ticking, like a living
      creature, upon the dressing-table where he had left it. His black morocco
      pocket-book was distinctly visible beside the looking-glass, and two
      spectral boots stood up amidst the varied shadows of the night. Grobey was
      very uncomfortable. He began to entertain the horrid idea that a fiend was
      hovering through his chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once he heard the door creaking upon its hinges. There was a slight
      rustling of muslin, a low sigh, and then momentary silence. "What, in the
      name of John Bright, can that be?" thought the terrified traveller; but he
      had not to wait long for explanation. The door opened slowly&mdash;a
      female figure, arrayed from head to foot in robes of virgin whiteness,
      glided in, and fixed her eyes, with an expression of deep solemnity and
      menace, upon the countenance of Grobey. He lay breathless and motionless
      beneath the spell. This might have lasted for about a minute, during which
      time, as Grobey expressed it, his very entrails were convulsed<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62b" id="Page_62b">[Pg 62]</a></span> with
      fear. The apparition then moved onwards, still keeping her eyes upon the
      couch. She stood for a moment near the window, raised her arm with a
      monitory gesture to the sky, and then all at once seemed to disappear as
      if absorbed in the watery moonshine. Grobey was as bold a bagman as ever
      flanked a mare with his gig-whip, but this awful visitation was too much.
      Boots, looking-glass, and table swam with a distracting whirl before his
      eyes; he uttered a feeble yell, and immediately lapsed into a swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was bright morning when he awoke. He started up, rubbed his eyes, and
      endeavoured to persuade himself that it was all an illusion. To be sure
      there were the boots untouched, the coat, the hat, and the portmanteau;
      but where&mdash;oh where&mdash;were the watch and the plethoric
      pocket-book, with its bunch of bank-notes and other minor memoranda? Gone&mdash;spirited
      away; and with a shout of despair old Grobey summoned the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police were straightway taken into his confidence. The tale of the
      midnight apparition&mdash;of the Demon Lady&mdash;was told and listened
      to, at first with somewhat of an incredulous smile; but when the landlord
      stated that an unknown damosel had been sojourning for two days at the
      hotel, that she had that morning vanished in a hackney-coach without
      leaving any trace of her address, and that, moreover, certain spoons of
      undeniable silver were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63b"
      id="Page_63b">[Pg 63]</a></span> amissing, Argus pricked up his ears, and
      after some few preliminary inquiries, issued forth in quest of the
      fugitive. Two days afterwards the fair Saville was discovered in a
      temperance hotel; and although the pocket-book had disappeared, both the
      recognisable notes and the watch were found in her possession. A number of
      pawn-tickets, also, which were contained in her reticule, served to
      collect from divers quarters a great mass of <i>bijouterie</i>, amongst
      which were the Blenheim spoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Mr Grobey's evidence as afterwards supplemented by the police.
      Tom rose to cross-examine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, Mr Grobey," said he, adjusting his gown upon his shoulders with a
      very knowing and determined air, as though he intended to expose his
      victim&mdash;"Pray, Mr Grobey, are you any judge of studs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't a racing man," replied Grobey, "but I knows an oss when I sees
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't equivocate, sir, if you please. Recollect you are upon your oath,"
      said Strachan, irritated by a slight titter which followed upon Grobey's
      answer. "I mean studs, sir&mdash;emerald studs for example?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ain't. But the lady is," replied Grobey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cos there vos five pair on them taken out of pawn with her tickets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64b" id="Page_64b">[Pg 64]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cos I see'd them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you at Jedburgh, sir, in the month of April last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you recollect seeing me there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember what passed upon that occasion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You was rather confluscated, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr Strachan," said the judge mildly, "I am always sorry to interrupt a
      young counsel, but I really cannot see the relevancy of these questions.
      The court can have nothing to do with your communications with the
      witness. I presume I need not take a note of these latter answers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, my lord," said Tom, rather discomfited at being cut out of his
      revenge on the bagman, "I shall ask him something else;" and he commenced
      his examination in right earnest. Grobey, however, stood steadfast to the
      letter of his previous testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another witness was called; and to my surprise the Scottish Vidocq
      appeared. He spoke to the apprehension and the search, and also to the
      character of the prisoner. In his eyes she had long been chronicled as
      habit and repute a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know the prisoner, then?" said Strachan rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65b" id="Page_65b">[Pg 65]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. Any time these three years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under what name is she known to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Betsy Brown is her real name, but she has gone by twenty others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By twenty, do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, or thereabouts. She always flies at high game; and, being a
      remarkably clever woman, she passes herself off for a lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever seen her elsewhere than in Glasgow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Jedburgh."
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot tell what impulse it was that made me twitch Strachan's gown at
      this moment. It was not altogether a suspicion, but rather a presentiment
      of coming danger. Strachan took the hint and changed his line.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you specify any of her other names?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can. There are half-a-dozen of them here on the pawn-tickets. Shall I
      read them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One diamond ring, pledged in name of Lady Emily Delaroche. A garnet
      brooch and chain&mdash;Miss Maria Mortimer. Three gold seals&mdash;Mrs
      Markham Vere. A watch and three emerald studs&mdash;the Honourable
      Dorothea Percy&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a loud shriek from the bar, and a bustle&mdash;the prisoner had
      fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66b" id="Page_66b">[Pg 66]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Strachan. He was absolutely as white as a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Tom," said I, "hadn't you better go out into the open air?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" was the firm reply; "I am here to do my duty, and I'll do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      And in effect, the Spartan boy with the fox gnawing into his side did not
      acquit himself more heroically than my friend. The case was a clear one,
      no doubt, but Tom made a noble speech, and was highly complimented by the
      Judge upon his ability. No sooner, however, had he finished it than he
      left the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw him two hours afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom," said I, "about these emerald studs&mdash;I think I could get them
      back from the Fiscal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep them to yourself. I'm off to India."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!&mdash;go down to the Highlands for a month."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom did so; purveyed himself a kilt; met an heiress at the Inverness
      Meeting, and married her. He is now the happy father of half-a-dozen
      children, and a good many of us would give a trifle for his practice. But
      to this day he is as mad as a March hare if an allusion is made in his
      presence to any kind of studs whatsoever.

      It would probably puzzle Mr William Wellington Hurst, as much as any man,
      to find out on what grounds I placed him on the list of my College
      friends; for certainly our intimacy was hardly sufficient to warrant such
      a liberty; and he was one of those happy individuals who would never have
      suspected that it could be out of gratitude for much amusement afforded me
      by sundry of his sayings and doings. But so it is; and it happens, that
      while the images of many others of my companions&mdash;very worthy good
      sort of fellows, whom I saw more or less of nearly every day&mdash;have
      vanished from my memory, or only flit across occasionally, like shadows,
      the full-length figure of Mr W. Wellington Hurst, exactly as he turned
      out, after a satisfactory toilet, in the patent boots and scarf of many
      colours, stands fixed there like a daguerreotype&mdash;more faithful than
      flattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68b" id="Page_68b">[Pg 68]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      My first introduction to him was by running him down in a skiff, when I
      was steering the College eight&mdash;not less to his astonishment than our
      own gratification. It is (or used to be) perfectly allowable, by the laws
      of the river, if, after due notice, these small craft fail to get out of
      your way; but it is not very easy to effect. However, in this instance, we
      went clean over him, very neatly indeed. The men helped him into our boat,
      just as his own sunk from under him; and he accepted a seat by my side in
      the stern-sheets, with many apologies for being so wet, appearing
      considerably impressed with a sense of my importance, and still more of my
      politeness. When we reached Sandford, I prescribed a stiff tumbler of hot
      brandy and water, and advised him to run all the way home, to warm
      himself, and avoid catching cold; and, from that time, I believe he always
      looked upon me as a benefactor. The claim, on my part, certainly rested on
      a very small foundation originally; it was strengthened afterwards by a
      less questionable act of patronage. Like many other under-graduates of
      every man's acquaintance in those days, Hurst laboured under the delusion,
      that holding two sets of reins in a very confused manner, and flourishing
      a long whip, was driving; and that to get twenty miles out of Oxford in a
      "team," without an upset, or an imposition from the proctor, was an <i>opus
      operatum</i> of the highest possible merit. To do him justice, he<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69b" id="Page_69b">[Pg 69]</a></span>
      laboured diligently in the only exercise which he seemed to consider
      strictly academical&mdash;he spent an hour every morning, standing upon a
      chair, "catching flies," as he called it, and occasionally flicking his
      scout, with a tandem whip; and practised incessantly upon tin horns of all
      lengths, with more zeal than melody, until he got the erysipelas in his
      lower lip, and a hint of rustication from the tutors. Yet he was more
      ambitious than successful. His reputation on the road grew worse and worse
      every day. He had a knack of shaving turnpike gates, and cutting round
      corners on one wheel, and getting his horses into every possible figure
      but a straight line, which made every mile got over without an accident
      almost a miracle. At last, after taking a four-in-hand over a narrow
      bridge, at the bottom of a hill, pretty much in the Olympic fashion&mdash;all
      four abreast&mdash;men got rather shy of any expeditions of the kind in
      his company. There was little credit in it, and a good deal of danger.
      First, he was reduced to soliciting the company of freshmen, who were
      flattered by any proposal that sounded <i>fast</i>. But they, too, grew
      shy, after one or two ventures; and poor Hurst soon found a difficulty in
      getting a companion at all. He was a liberal fellow enough, and not pushed
      for a guinea when his darling science was concerned: so he used to offer
      to "sport the team" himself; but even when he condescended to the
      additional self-devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70b"
      id="Page_70b">[Pg 70]</a></span> of "standing a dinner and champagne," he
      found that the closest calculators among his sporting acquaintance had as
      much regard for their necks as their pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this inglorious position was his fame as a charioteer reduced, when
      Horace Leicester and myself, early in his third term, had determined
      somewhat suddenly to go to see a steeple-chase about twelve miles off,
      where Leicester had some attraction besides the horses, in the shape of a
      pretty cousin; (<i>two</i>, he told me, and bribed me with the promise of
      an introduction to "the other," but she did not answer to sample at all.)
      We had engaged a very nice mare and stanhope, which we knew we could
      depend upon, when, the day before the race, the chestnut was declared
      lame, and not a presentable four-legged animal was to be hired in Oxford.
      Hurst had engaged his favourite pair of greys (which would really go very
      well with any other driver) a week beforehand, but had been canvassing the
      last batch of freshmen in vain for an occupant of the vacant seat. A huge
      red-headed north-country man, who had never seen a tandem in his life, but
      who, as far as pluck went, would have ridden postilion to Medea's dragons,
      was listening with some apparent indecision to Hurst's eloquence upon the
      delights of driving, just as we came up after a last unsuccessful search
      through the livery stables; and the pair were proceeding<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71b" id="Page_71b">[Pg 71]</a></span> out of
      college arm in arm, probably to look at the greys, when Leicester, to my
      amusement, stepped up with&mdash;"Hurst, who's going with you to B&mdash;&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;why, I hardly know yet; I think Sands here will, if"&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go with you then, if you like; and if you've got a cart,<a
      name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
      class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Hawthorne can come too, and it will be very
      jolly."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the university had announced their intention of creating him a B.A. by
      diploma, without examination, Hurst could hardly have looked more
      surprised and delighted. Leicester, it should be borne in mind, was one of
      the most popular men in the college&mdash;a sort of <i>arbiter
      elegantiarum</i> in the best set. Hurst knew very little of him, but was
      no doubt highly flattered by his proposal. From coaxing freshmen to come
      out by the bribe of paying all expenses, to driving to B&mdash;&mdash;
      steeple-chase side by side with Horace (my modesty forbids me to include
      myself), was a step at once from the ridiculous to the sublime of
      tandemizing. For this advancement in life, he always, I fancy, considered
      himself indebted to me, as I had originally introduced him to Leicester's
      acquaintance; and when we both accepted an invitation, which he delivered
      himself of with some hesitation, to breakfast in his rooms on the morning
      of the expedition, his joy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72b"
      id="Page_72b">[Pg 72]</a></span> gratitude appeared to know no bounds. It
      is not usual, be it remembered, for a junior man in college to ask a
      senior to a party from whom he has never received an invitation himself;
      but hunting and tandem-driving are apt occasionally to set ordinary
      etiquette at defiance. "Don't ask a lot of men, that's all&mdash;there's a
      good fellow," said Horace, whose good-natured smile, and off-hand and
      really winning manner, enabled him to carry off, occasionally, a degree of
      impudence which would not have been tolerated from others&mdash;"I hate a
      large formal breakfast party of all things; it disgusts me to see a score
      of men jostling each other over tough beefsteaks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked Sands yesterday," apologised Hurst. "I thought perhaps he would
      come out with me; but I daresay I can put him off, if"&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! on no account whatever; you mean the carroty freshman I saw you with
      just now? Have him by all means; it will be quite refreshing to meet any
      man so regularly green. So there will be just four of us; eight o'clock, I
      suppose? it won't do to be much later."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Horace walked off, having thus arranged matters to his own
      satisfaction and his host's. I was an interested party in the business,
      however, and had my own terms to make. "You've disposed of me rather
      coolly," said I; "you don't surely imagine that at my time of life I'm
      going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73b" id="Page_73b">[Pg 73]</a></span>
      to trust my neck to that fellow's abominable driving?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make your mind easy, Frank; William Wellington sha'n't finger a riband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, Leicester; you can't treat a man in that kind of way&mdash;not
      to let him drive his own team. Hurst <i>is</i> a bit of an ass, certainly;
      but you can't with any decency first ask a man for a seat, and then refuse
      to give him up the reins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I in the habit, sir, of doing things in the very rude and
      ungentlemanly style you insinuate?" And Horace looked at me with mock
      dignity for a second or two, and then burst into a laugh. "Leave it to me,
      Hawthorne, and I'll manage it to the satisfaction of all parties: I'll
      promise you that Hurst shall have a capital day's fun, and your valuable
      neck shall be as safe as if you were tried by a Welsh jury."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this indefinite assurance I was obliged to be content; and
      accordingly, at half-past eight the next morning, after a very correct
      breakfast, we mounted the tandem-cart at the college back-gates, got the
      leader hitched on, as usual, a mile out of the city, for fear of proctors,
      and were bowling merrily along, in the slight frost of an autumn morning,
      towards B&mdash;&mdash;. Leicester took the driving first, by Hurst's
      special request, after one or two polite but faint refusals, the latter
      sitting by his side; while I occupied, for the present, the queer little
      box which in those days was stuck on<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_74b" id="Page_74b">[Pg 74]</a></span> behind, (the more modern
      carts, which hold four, are an improvement introduced into the University
      since my driving days). With wonderful gravity and importance did
      Leicester commence his lectures on the whip to his admiring companion: I
      almost think he began in the approved style, with a slight allusion to the
      Roman <i>biga</i>, and deduced the progress of the noble science from
      Ericthonius down to "Peyton and Ward." I have a lively recollection of a
      comparison between Automedon of the Homeric times, and "Black Will" of
      Oxford celebrity&mdash;the latter being decided as only likely to be less
      immortal, because there was no Homer among the contemporary
      under-graduates. A good deal was lost to me, no doubt, from my position
      behind; but Hurst seemed to suck it all in with every disposition to be
      edified. From the history of his subject, Horace proceeded, in due course,
      to the theory, from theory to facts, from facts to illustrations. In the
      practical department, Horace, I suspect, like many other lecturers, was on
      his weakest ground; for his own driving partook of the general
      under-graduate character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You throw the lash out so&mdash;you see&mdash;and bring it back sharp, so&mdash;no,
      not <i>so</i> exactly&mdash;so&mdash;hang the thing, I can't do it now;
      but that's the principle, you understand&mdash;and then you take up your
      double thong, so&mdash;pshaw, I did it very well just now&mdash;to put it
      into the wheeler, so&mdash;ah, I missed it then, but that's the way to do
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75b" id="Page_75b">[Pg 75]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      He put me considerably in mind of a certain professor of chemistry, whose
      lectures on light and heat I once was rash enough to attend, who, after a
      long dry disquisition which had nearly put us all to sleep, used to arouse
      our attention to the "beautiful effects" produced by certain combinations,
      which he would proceed to illustrate, as he said, by a "little
      experiment." But, somehow or other, these little experiments always, or
      nearly always, failed: and after the room had been darkened, perhaps, for
      five minutes or so, in order to give the exhibition full effect, the
      result would be, a <i>fizz</i> or two, a faint blue light, and a stink,
      varying according to circumstances, but always abominable. "It's very odd,
      John," the discomfited operator used to exclaim to his assistant; "very
      odd; and we succeeded so well this morning, too: it's most unaccountable:
      I'm really very sorry, gentlemen, but I can assure you, this very same
      experiment we tried to-day with the most beautiful result; didn't we,
      John?" "We did, sir," was John's invariably dutiful reply; and so the
      audience took John's word for it, and the experiment was considered to
      have been, virtually, successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we rattled on to the ground: Leicester occasionally putting the reins
      into his companion's hand, teaching him to perform some impossible
      movement with his third finger, and directing his attention to
      non-existent flies, which he professed to remove<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_76b" id="Page_76b">[Pg 76]</a></span> from the leader, out of
      sheer compassion, with the point of the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are sure you wouldn't like to take the reins now? Well, you'll drive
      home then, of course? Hawthorne, will you try your hand now? Hurst's going
      to take up the tooling when we come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you," said I; "I won't interfere with either of your
      performances."&mdash;"And if Hurst does drive home," was my mental
      determination, expressed to Leicester as far as a nod could do it, "I'll
      walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no difficulty in finding out the localities: the field in which
      the winning-flag was fixed was not far from the turnpike road, and
      conspicuous enough by the crowd already there collected. Of course, pretty
      nearly all the sporting characters among the gownsmen were there, the
      distance from the University being so trifling. Mounted on that seedy
      description of animal peculiar to Oxford livery-stables, which can never
      by any possibility be mistaken for anything but a hired affair, but will
      generally go all day, and scramble through almost anything; with showily
      mounted jockey-whips in their hands, bad cigars (at two guineas a-pound)
      in their mouths, bright blue scarfs, or something equivalent, round their
      necks&mdash;their neat white cords and tops (things which they <i>did</i>
      turn out well in Oxford) being the only really sportsmanlike article about
      them; flattering themselves they looked exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_77b" id="Page_77b">[Pg 77]</a></span> knowing, and, in nine
      cases out of ten, being deceived therein most lamentably; clustered
      together in groups of four or five, discussing the merits of the horses,
      or listening, as to an oracle, to the opinion of some Oxford horse-dealer,
      delivered with insolent familiarity&mdash;here were the men who drank out
      of a fox's head, and recounted imaginary runs with the Heythrop. Happy was
      he amongst them, and a positive hero for the day, who could boast a
      speaking acquaintance with any of those anomalous individuals, at present
      enshrouded in great-coats, but soon to appear in all the varieties of
      jockey costume, known by the style and title of "gentlemen riders;" who
      could point out, confidentially, to his admiring companions, "Jack B&mdash;&mdash;,"
      and "Little M&mdash;&mdash;," and announce, from authority, how many
      ounces under weight one was this morning, and how many blankets were put
      upon the other the night before, to enable him to come to the scales at
      all. Here and there, more plainly dressed, moving about quickly on their
      own thorough-breds, or talking to some neighbouring squire who knew the
      ground, were the few really sporting men belonging to the University; who
      kept hunters in Oxford, simply because they were used to keep them at
      home, and had been brought up to look upon fox-hunting as their future
      vocation. Lolling on their saddles, probably voting it all a bore, were
      two or three tufts, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78b"
      id="Page_78b">[Pg 78]</a></span> "tail;" and stuck into all sorts of
      vehicles, lawful and unlawful, buggies, drags, and tandems, were that
      ignoble herd, who, like myself, had come to the steeple-chase, just
      because it was the most convenient idleness at hand, and because other men
      were going. There were all sorts of people there besides, of course:
      carriages of all grades of pretension, containing pretty bonnets and ugly
      faces, in the usual proportion; "all the beauty and fashion of the
      neighbourhood," nevertheless, as the county paper assured us; and as I may
      venture to add, from personal observation, a very fair share of its
      disreputability and blackguardism besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      After wandering for a short time among these various groups, Leicester
      halted us at last in front of one of those old-fashioned
      respectable-looking barouches, which one now so seldom sees, in which were
      seated a party, who turned out to consist of an uncle and aunt, and the
      pair of cousins before alluded to. Hurst and I were duly introduced; a
      ceremony which, for my own part, I could have very readily excused, when I
      discovered that the only pair of eyes in the party worth mentioning
      bestowed their glances almost exclusively on Horace, and any attempt at
      cutting into the conversation in that quarter was as hopeless, apparently,
      as ungracious. Our friend's taste in the article of cousins was undeniably
      correct; Flora Leicester was a most desirable person to have for a cousin;
      very pretty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79b" id="Page_79b">[Pg 79]</a></span>
      very good-humoured, and (I am sure she was, though I pretend to no
      experience of the fact) very affectionate. If one could have put in any
      claim of kindred, even in the third or fourth degree, it would have been a
      case in which to stickle hard for the full privileges of relationship. As
      matters stood, it was trying enough to the sensibilities of us unfortunate
      bystanders, whose cousins were either ugly or at a distance; for the rest
      of our new acquaintances were not interesting. The younger sister was shy
      and insipid; the squire like ninety-nine squires in every hundred; and the
      lady-mother in a perpetual state of real or affected nervous agitation, to
      which her own family were happily insensible, but which taxed a stranger's
      polite sympathies pretty heavily. Though constantly in the habit, as she
      assured me, of accompanying her husband to race-courses, and enjoying the
      sport, she was always on the look-out for an accident, and was always
      having, as she said, narrow escapes; some indeed so very narrow, that,
      according to her own account, they ought to have had, by every rule of
      probability, fatal terminations. In fact, her tone might have led one to
      believe that she looked upon herself as an ill-used woman in getting off
      so easily&mdash;at least she was exceedingly angry when the younger
      daughter ventured to remark, <i>en pendant</i> to one of her most
      thrilling adventures, that "there was no great danger of an<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80b" id="Page_80b">[Pg 80]</a></span> upset
      when the wheel stuck fast." Not content with putting her head out of the
      carriage every five minutes, to see if her own well-trained bays were
      standing quiet, as they always did, there was not a restive horse or
      awkward rider on the ground but attracted the good lady's ever watchful
      sense of danger. "He'll be thrown! I'm sure he will! foolish man, why
      don't he get off!" "Oh, oh! there they go! they're off, those horrid
      horses! they'll never stop 'em!" Such were the interjections, accompanied
      with extraordinary shudderings and drawings of the breath, with which Mrs
      John Leicester, her eyes fixed on some distant point, occasionally broke
      in upon the general conversation, sometimes with a vehemence that startled
      even her nephew and eldest daughter, though, to do them justice, they paid
      very little attention to any of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was meditating something desperate, in order to relieve myself
      from the office of soother-general of Mrs Leicester's imaginary terrors,
      and to bring Flora's sunny face once more within my line of vision (she
      had been turning the back of her bonnet upon me perseveringly for the last
      ten minutes), a general commotion gave us notice that the horses were
      started, and the race begun. The hill on which we were stationed was close
      to the winning-post, and commanded a view of pretty nearly the whole
      ground from the start. The race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81b"
      id="Page_81b">[Pg 81]</a></span> was, I suppose, pretty nearly like other
      steeple-chases, and there is the less need for me to describe it, because
      a very full and particular account appeared in the <i>Bell's Life</i> next
      ensuing. The principal impressions which remain on my mind, are of a very
      smart gentleman in black and crimson, mounted on a very powerful bay, who
      seemed as if he had been taking it easy, who came in first, and after
      having been sufficiently admired by an innocent public, myself among the
      number, as the winner, turned out to have gone on the right hand instead
      of the left of some flag or other, and to have lost the race accordingly;
      and of a very dirty-looking person, who arrived some minute or two
      afterwards without a cap, whose jacket was green and his horse grey, so
      far as the mud left any colour visible, and who, to the great
      disappointment of the ladies especially, turned out to be the real hero
      after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had made arrangements to have an independent beefsteak together after
      the race, in preference to joining the sporting ordinary announced as
      usual on such occasions; but the squire insisted on Leicester bringing us
      both to dine with his party at five. After a few modest and conscientious
      scruples on my part, at intruding on the hospitality of comparative
      strangers, and a strong private remonstrance from Hurst, on the
      impropriety of sitting down to dinner with ladies in a<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_82b" id="Page_82b">[Pg 82]</a></span> surtout and white cords,
      we accepted the invitation, and betook ourselves to kill the intervening
      hour or so as we best could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Horace," said I, as Hurst went off to make his apology for a
      toilette&mdash;"how are you going to settle about the driving home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! never fear; I'll manage it: I have just seen Miller and Fane; they've
      got a drag over here, and there's lots of room inside; so they've promised
      to take Hurst home with them, if we can only manage to leave him behind:
      they are going to dine here, and are sure not to go home till late; and we
      must be off early, you know, because I have some men coming to supper; so
      we'll leave our friend behind, somehow or other. A painful necessity, I
      admit; but it must be done, even if I have to lock him up in the stable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leicester seemed to have more confidence in his own resources than I had;
      but he was in too great a state of excitement to listen to any demurrers
      of mine on the point, and hurried us off to join his friends. Ushered into
      the drawing-room A.1. of the Saracen's Head, we found <i>la bella</i>
      Flora awaiting us alone, the rest of the family being not as yet visible.
      There was not the slightest necessity for inquiring whether she felt
      fatigued, for she was looking even more lovely than in the morning; or
      whether she had been amused or not, for if the steeple-chase had not
      delighted her, something else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83b"
      id="Page_83b">[Pg 83]</a></span> had, for there was a radiant smile on her
      face which could not be mistaken. Hurst was cut short rather abruptly in a
      speech which appeared tending towards a compliment, by Leicester's
      inquiring&mdash;"My good fellow, have you seen the horses fed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, upon my word," said Hurst, "I"&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I have then; but I wish you would just step across the yard, and
      see if that stupid ostler has rubbed them dry, as I told him. You
      understand those things, I know, Hurst&mdash;the fellows won't humbug you
      very easily; as to Hawthorne, I wouldn't trust him to see to anything of
      the sort. Flora here knows more about a horse than he does."
    </p>
    <p>
      Any compliment to Hurst's acuteness in the matter of horse-flesh was sure
      to have its effect, and he walked off with an air of some importance to
      discharge his commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then," said Horace eagerly, "we have got rid of him for ten minutes,
      which was all I wanted; if you please, Flora dear, we must have your
      cleverness to help us in a little difficulty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said Miss Leicester, colouring a little, as her cousin, in his
      eagerness, seized her hand in both of his&mdash;"what scrape have you got
      into now, Horace, and how can I possibly help you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I want you to hit upon some plan for keeping that fellow Hurst here
      after we are gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay; you don't know what I mean. I'll tell<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_84b" id="Page_84b">[Pg 84]</a></span> you why&mdash;if he
      drives home to Oxford, he'll infallibly upset us; and drive he must if he
      goes home with us, because, in fact, the team is his, and I drove them all
      the way here, and it's his turn back, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why, in the multitude of absurdities which you Oxonians perpetrate&mdash;I
      beg your pardon, Mr Hawthorne&mdash;but why need you have come out in a
      tandem at all, with a man who can't drive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply, Flora, because I had no other way of coming at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was very absurd in us, Miss Leicester, I allow," said I, "but you know
      what an attraction a steeple-chase is, to your cousin especially; and
      after having made up his mind to come&mdash;altogether, you see, it would
      have been a disappointment"&mdash;(to all parties, I had a mind to add,
      but I thought the balance was on my side without it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," said Horace, "I shouldn't care a straw to run the chance, as
      far as I am concerned. I dare say the horses will go home straight enough,
      if he'll only let them: or if he wouldn't, I shouldn't mind knocking him
      off the box at once&mdash;by accident; but Frank here is rather
      particular, and I promised him I would not let Hurst drive. I thought
      once, if we had dined by ourselves, of persuading him he was drunk, and
      sending him home in a fly; but I am afraid, as matters stand, that plea is
      hardly practicable."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85b" id="Page_85b">[Pg 85]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could I persuade him to let you or Mr Hawthorne drive, do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace looked at her as if he thought, as I dare say he did, that his
      cousin Flora could, if she were so minded, persuade a man to do anything;
      so I was compelled, somewhat at the expense of my reputation for
      gallantry, to assure them both, that if Ulysses of old, among his various
      arts and accomplishments, had piqued himself upon his tandem-driving, his
      vanity would have stopped his ears effectually, and the Syren might have
      sung herself hoarse before he would have given up the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give the Boots half-a-crown to steal his hat," said Horace, "and
      start while he is looking for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay," said his cousin; "I dare say it may be managed." But I thought she
      looked disappointed. "Did you know we were all going to the B&mdash;&mdash;
      theatre to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! really! what fun!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No fun for you; for you must start early, as you said just now. The
      owners of the horses here patronise a play, and they have made papa
      promise to go, and so we must, I suppose, and"&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! we'll all go, of course," said Horace decidedly.&mdash;"You'll stay
      and go, won't you, Hawthorne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget your supper party," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! hang it, they'll take care of themselves, so long as the supper's
      there; they won't miss me much."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86b" id="Page_86b">[Pg 86]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't I hear something of your being confined to college after nine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes; I believe I am&mdash;but it won't matter much for once; I'll
      call on the dean to-morrow, and explain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Horace, that won't do; you and Mr Hawthorne must go home like
      good boys," said Flora, with a smile only half as merry as usual, "and
      Mary and I will persuade Mr Hurst to stay and go to the theatre with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! confound it!"&mdash;Horace began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! here comes papa; remember this is my arrangement; you ought to be
      very much obliged, instead of beginning to swear in that way; I'm sure Mr
      Hawthorne is very grateful to me for taking so much interest in the
      question of his breaking his neck, if you are not. Oh! papa," she
      continued, "do you know that we shall lose all our beaux to-night; they
      have some horrid supper party to go back to, and we shall have to go to
      the play by ourselves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the Squire's sympathies were at this moment absorbed in the fact
      that dinner was already four minutes late, so that he had less to spare
      for his daughter's disappointment than Mrs Leicester, who on her arrival
      took up the lamentation with all her heart. She attacked her nephew at
      once upon the subject, whose replies were at first wavering and evasive,
      till he caught Flora's eye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87b"
      id="Page_87b">[Pg 87]</a></span> and then he answered with a dogged sort
      of resolution, exceedingly amusing to me who understood his position, and
      at last got quite cross with his aunt for persisting in her entreaties. I
      declared, for my part, that I was dependent on Horace's movements; that,
      if I could possibly have anticipated the delightful evening which had
      awaited us, every other arrangement should have given way, &amp;c. &amp;c.;
      when Hurst's reappearance turned the whole force of Mrs Leicester's
      persuasions upon him, backed, too, as she was by both her daughters.
      "Won't <i>you</i> stay, Mr Hurst? Must you go too? Will you be so shabby
      as to leave us?" How could any man stand it? William Wellington Hurst
      could not, it was very plain. At first he looked astonished; wondered why
      on earth we couldn't all stay; then protested he couldn't think of letting
      us go home by ourselves; a piece of self-devotion which we at once desired
      might not be thought of; then hesitated&mdash;he was meditating, no doubt,
      on the delight of driving&mdash;how was he to get home? the inglorious
      occupant of the inside of a drag; or the solitary tenant of a fly (though
      I suggested he might drive that if he pleased); couldn't Leicester go
      home, and I and he follow together? I put in a decided negative; he looked
      from Mrs Leicester's anxious face to Flora's, and surrendered at
      discretion. We were to start at eight precisely in the tandem, and Miller
      and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88b" id="Page_88b">[Pg 88]</a></span>
      party, who were sure to wait for the play, were to pick up Mr Wellington
      Hurst as a supernumerary passenger at some hour unknown. And so we went to
      dinner. Mrs Leicester marched off in triumph with her new capture, as if
      fearful he might give her the slip after all, and committed Flora to my
      custody. I was charitable enough, however, in consideration of all
      circumstances, to give up my right of sitting next to her to Horace, and
      established myself on the other side of the table, between Mrs Leicester
      and her younger daughter; and a hard post I had of it. Mary would not talk
      at all, and her mamma would do nothing else; and she was one of those
      pertinacious talkers, too, who, not content with running on themselves,
      and leaving you to put in an occasional interjection, inflict upon you a
      cross-examination in its severest form, and insist upon a definite and
      rational answer to every question. However, availing myself of those
      legitimate qualifications of a witness, an unlimited amount of impudence,
      and a determination not to criminate myself, I got on pretty tolerably.
      Who did I think her daughter Flora like? I took the opportunity of
      diligently examining that young lady's features for about four minutes&mdash;not
      in the least to her confusion, for she scarcely honoured me with a glance
      the whole time&mdash;and then declared the resemblance to mamma quite
      startling. Mary? Oh, her father's eyes decidedly; upon<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_89b" id="Page_89b">[Pg 89]</a></span> which the squire, whose
      pet she appeared to be&mdash;I suppose it was the contrast between her
      quietness and Mrs Leicester's incessant fidgetting that was so delightful&mdash;laughed,
      and took wine with me. Then she took up the subject of my private tastes
      and habits. Was I fond of riding? Yes. Driving? Pretty well. Reading?
      Very. Then she considerately hoped that I did not read much by
      candle-light&mdash;above all by an oil-lamp&mdash;it was very injurious. I
      assured her that I would be cautious for the future. Then she offered me a
      receipt for eye-water, in case I suffered from weakness arising from
      over-exertion of those organs;&mdash;declined, with thanks. Hoped I did
      not read above twelve hours a-day; some young men, she had heard, read
      sixteen, which she considered as really inconsistent with a due regard to
      health. I assured her that our sentiments on that point perfectly
      coincided, and that I had no tendency to excesses of that kind. At last
      she began to institute inquiries about certain under-graduates with whose
      families she was acquainted; and the two or three names which I recognised
      being hunting men, I referred her to Hurst as quite <i>au fait</i> in the
      sporting circles of Oxford, and succeeded in hooking them into a
      conversation which effectually relieved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leicester, as I could overhear, had been still rather rebellious against
      going home before the play was over, and was insisting that his being in<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90b" id="Page_90b">[Pg 90]</a></span>
      college by nine was not really material; nor did he appear over-pleased,
      when, in answer to an appeal from Flora, I said plainly, that the
      consequences of his "knocking in" late, when under sentence of strict
      confinement to the regular hour, might not be pleasant&mdash;a fact,
      however, which he himself, though with a very bad grace, was compelled to
      admit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the time arrived for our party to separate: Horace and I to return
      to Oxford, and the others to adjourn to see <i>Richard the Third</i>
      performed at the B&mdash;&mdash; theatre, under the distinguished
      patronage of the members of the H&mdash;&mdash; Hunt. It was a beautiful
      moonlight night, and as Hurst accompanied us to the stable-yard to "start
      us," as he complacently phrased it, it was clear that he was suffering,
      like a great many unfortunate individuals in public and private life,
      under an overweening sense of his own importance. "You'll have an uncommon
      pleasant drive of it; upon my word you will," he remarked; "it wouldn't do
      for me to say I would not stay, you know, as Miss Leicester&mdash;Mrs
      Leicester, that is&mdash;seemed to make such a point of it; but really"&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come, Hurst," said I, "don't pretend to say you've made any sacrifice
      in the matter; I know you are quite delighted; I'm sure I should have
      liked to stay of all things, only it would have been uncivil to our friend
      here to send him home by himself from his own party."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91b" id="Page_91b">[Pg 91]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! hang it, I don't mean to call it a sacrifice; I have no doubt I shall
      have a very pleasant evening; only I wish we could all have stayed, and
      driven home together afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may keep Hawthorne with you now, if you like," said Horace, who was
      not in the best of tempers; "I can take the horses home myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, that would be hardly fair," said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no&mdash;off with you both," said Hurst; "stay, Leicester, you'll
      find the grey go more pleasantly if you drive him from the cheek; I'll
      alter it in a second."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have the goodness just to let them alone, my good fellow; as I'm to
      drive, I prefer putting them my own way, if you have no objection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as you please; good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miller's coming to my rooms when he gets home; if you like to look in
      with him, you'll find some supper, I dare say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace continued rather sulky for the first few miles, and only opened to
      anathematise, briefly but comprehensively, steeple-chases, tandems, deans
      and tutors, and "fellows like Hurst." I thought it best to let him cool
      down a little; so, after this ebullition, we rattled on in silence as long
      as his first cigar lasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," said I, as I gave him a light, "we got rid of our friend's company
      pretty cleverly, thanks to your cousin."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92b" id="Page_92b">[Pg 92]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, I told you I'd take care of that; ha, ha! poor Hurst! he little
      bargained, when he ordered his team, how precious little driving he was to
      get out of it; a strong instance of the vanity of human expectations. I
      wish him joy of it, stuck up in an old barn, as I suppose he is by this
      time, gaping at a set of strolling players; how Flora will laugh at him! I
      really shouldn't wonder if she were to tell him, before the evening is
      over, how nicely he has been humbugged, just for the fun of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events," said I, "I think we must have a laugh at him to-night
      when he comes home; though he's such a good-tempered fellow, it's rather a
      shame, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very plain, however, that it was not quite such a good joke to
      Master Horace himself as he was trying to make out; and that, in point of
      fact, he would have considerably preferred being seated, as Hurst probably
      was at that moment, by his pretty cousin's side in the B&mdash;&mdash;
      theatre, wherever and whatever that might chance to be (even with the full
      expectation of being laughed at afterwards), to holding the reins of the
      best team that ever was turned out of Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached Oxford just in time to hear the first stroke of "Old Tom." By
      the time I joined Leicester in his rooms, supper was ready, and most of
      the party assembled. The sport of the day was duly discussed; those who
      knew least about such matters being proportionately the most noisy and<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93b" id="Page_93b">[Pg 93]</a></span>
      positive in giving their opinions. One young hero of eighteen, fresh from
      Winchester, in all the importance of a probationary Fellow of New College,
      explained for our benefit, by the help of the forks and salt-cellars, the
      line which the horses undoubtedly ought to have taken, and which they did
      not take; until one of his old schoolfellows, who was present, was
      provoked to treat us to an anecdote of the young gentleman's first
      appearance in the hunting-field&mdash;no longer ago than the last term&mdash;when
      he mistook the little rough Scotch terrier that always accompanied &mdash;&mdash;'s
      pack for the fox, and tally-ho'd him so lustily as to draw upon himself
      sundry very energetic, but not very complimentary, remarks from the
      well-known master of the hounds. By degrees Leicester recovered his usual
      good-humour; and supper passed over, and several songs had been sung with
      the usual amount of applause (except one very sentimental one which had no
      chorus), and we had got pretty deep into punch and politics, without
      Hurst's name having once been mentioned by either of us. A knock at the
      oak, and in walked Fane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you're come back at last?" said Horace. "Sit down, if you can find
      room. Allow me to introduce your left-hand neighbour&mdash;Powell of
      Merton,&mdash;Fane, one of our brightest ornaments; quite the <i>spes
      gregis</i> we consider him; passed his little go, and started a pink only
      last week; give him a glass of punch. Perhaps you are not aware we've<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94b" id="Page_94b">[Pg 94]</a></span> been
      drinking your health. But, by the way, Fane, where's our friend
      Wellington?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?" said Fane; "what on earth are you talking about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wellington Hurst; didn't <i>you</i> bring him home with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not; didn't you bring him home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; Miller promised me he should have a seat inside your drag, because we
      could not wait for him; did you stay to the play?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and capital fun it was; by the way, the last time I saw your friend
      Hurst was mounted up in a red baise place that was railed off for the
      patrons and patronesses, as they called them; there he was in the front
      row, doing the civil to a very odd-looking old dowager in bright blue
      velvet, with a neck like an ostrich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Leicester, "that's my aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, on that ground, we'll drink her health," said Fane, whose coolness
      was proverbial. "There was Hurst, however, sitting between her and an
      uncommonly pretty girl, with dark hair and eyes, dressed in&mdash;let me
      see"&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind; it was one of my cousins, I suppose," interposed Horace, who
      was engaged in lighting a cigar at the candle, apparently with more zeal
      than success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we'll drink <i>her</i> health for her own sake, if you have no
      particular objection. I've no doubt the rest of the company will take my
      word for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95b" id="Page_95b">[Pg 95]</a></span>
      being the prettiest girl on the ground to-day; Hurst would second me if he
      were here, for I never saw a man making love more decidedly in my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff!" said Horace, pitching his cigar into the fire; "pass that punch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! jealous, Leicester?" said two or three of the party&mdash;"preserved
      ground, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, not at all," said Horace, trying with a very bad grace to
      laugh off his evident annoyance; "at all events, I don't consider Hurst a
      very formidable poacher; but what I want to know is, how he didn't come
      home with Miller and your party?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miller said he was coming up directly, so you can ask him; I really heard
      nothing of it. Hark, there are steps coming up the staircase now."
    </p>
    <p>
      It proved to be Miller himself, followed by the under-porter, a
      good-tempered fellow, who was the factotum of the under-graduates at late
      hours, when the ordinary staff of servants had left college for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, Leicester?" said he, as he walked straight to the little
      pantry, or "scouts' room," immediately opposite the door, which forms part
      of the usual suite of college apartments; "come here, Bob."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Hurst?" was Horace's impatient query.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a bit," replied Miller from inside, where he was rattling the plates
      in the course of investigating the remains of the supper&mdash;he was not
      the man to go to bed supperless after a twelve miles' drive. "Here, Bob,"
      he continued, as he emerged at last with a cold fowl&mdash;"take this
      fellow down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96b" id="Page_96b">[Pg 96]</a></span>
      with you, and grill him in no time; here's a lump of butter&mdash;and
      Harvey's sauce&mdash;and&mdash;where do you keep the pickled mushrooms,
      Leicester? here they are&mdash;make a little gravy; and here, Bob&mdash;it's
      a cold night&mdash;here's a glass of wine; now you'll drink Mr Leicester's
      health, and vanish."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob drank the toast audibly, floored his tumbler of port at two gulps, and
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said Horace, "do just tell me&mdash;what <i>is</i> become of Hurst?
      how didn't you bring him home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confound it!" said Miller, as he looked into all the jugs&mdash;"no
      whisky punch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, really I forgot it; here's bishop, and that brandy punch is very
      good. But how didn't he come home with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgot it!" soliloquised Miller pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgot it? how the deuce came you to forget it? and how will he come
      now?" rejoined Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How came <i>you</i> to forget it? I was talking about the whisky punch,"
      said Miller, as we all roared with laughter. "I couldn't bring Hurst, you
      know, if he wouldn't come. He left the playhouse even before we did, with
      some ladies&mdash;and we came away before it was over&mdash;so I sent up
      to tell him we were going to start in ten minutes, and had a place for
      him; and the Boots came down and said they had just had supper in, and the
      gentleman could not possibly come just yet. Well, I sent up again, just as
      we were ready harnessed, and then he threatened to kick Boots down
      stairs."
    </p>
    <hr class="chap" />
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97b" id="Page_97b">[Pg 97]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a puppy!" said Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite agree with you there: I don't pretend to much sentiment
      myself, as you are all aware; but with a lady <i>and</i> a supper in the
      case, I should feel perfectly justified in kicking down stairs any Boots
      that ever wore shoes, if he hinted at my moving prematurely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller's unusual enthusiasm amused us all except Horace. "Gad," said he,
      at last, "I hope he won't be able to get home to-night at all!" In this
      friendly wish he was doomed to be disappointed. It was now long past
      twelve o'clock; the out-college members of the party had all taken their
      leave; Miller and Fane, having finished their grilled chicken at a little
      table in the corner, had now drawn round the fire with the three or four
      of us who remained, and there was a debate as to the expediency of brewing
      more punch, when we heard a running step in the Quadrangle, which
      presently began to ascend the staircase in company with a not very
      melodious voice, warbling in a style which bespoke the owner's high state
      of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! that's Hurst to a certainty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queen of my soul, whose starlike eyes<br /> Are all the light I seek"&mdash;&mdash;<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      (Here came an audible stumble, as if our friend were beginning his way
      down again involuntarily by half-a-dozen steps at a time.) "Hallo!
      Leicester!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98b" id="Page_98b">[Pg 98]</a></span>
      just lend us a candle, will you? The lamp is gone out, and it's as dark as
      pitch; I've dropped my hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open the door, somebody," said Horace; and Hurst was admitted. He looked
      rather confused at first, certainly; for the sudden transition from outer
      darkness into a small room lighted by a dozen wax candles made him blink,
      and our first greeting consisting of "ha&mdash;ha's" in different keys,
      was perhaps somewhat embarrassing; but he recovered himself in a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, "how are you all? glad you got home safe, Hawthorne; hope
      I didn't keep you waiting, Miller? you got the start of me, all of you,
      coming home; but really I spent an uncommon jolly evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to hear it," said Leicester, with a wink to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes;&mdash;'pon my life; I don't know when I ever spent so pleasant a
      one;" and, with a sort of chuckle to himself, Hurst filled a glass of
      punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you think of <i>Richard the Third</i>?" said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! hang the play! there might have been six Richards in the field for
      all I can say: I was better engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said Fane, "I rather fancy you were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had a very pleasant drive home," said I, willing to effect a diversion
      in favour of Leicester, who was puffing desperately at his cigar in a
      savage kind of silence;&mdash;"and a capital supper afterwards; I wish you
      had been with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I had a very jolly drive too: I got a gig, and galloped nearly all
      the way; and a very good supper, too, before I started; but I won't return
      your compliment;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99b" id="Page_99b">[Pg
      99]</a></span> we were a very snug party without you. Upon my word,
      Leicester, your eldest cousin is one of the very nicest girls I ever met:
      the sort of person you get acquainted with at once, and so very lively and
      good-humoured&mdash;no nonsense about her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll make a point of letting her know your good opinion," replied Horace,
      in a tone conveying pretty plainly a rebuke of such presumption. But it
      was lost upon Hurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably you need not trouble yourself," said Fane: "I dare say he has
      let her know it himself already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;really no"&mdash;said Hurst, as if deprecating anything so
      decided; "but Miss Leicester is a <i>very</i> nice girl; clever, I should
      say, decidedly; there's a shade of&mdash;one can hardly call it rusticity&mdash;about
      her manner; but I like it, myself&mdash;I like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you?"&mdash;said Horace, very drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! a season in London would take all that off." And Hurst began to
      quaver again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queen of my soul, whose"&mdash;<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you what," said Horace, rising, and standing with his back to
      the fire, with his hands under his coat-tails&mdash;"You may not be aware
      of it, but you're rather drunk, Hurst."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drunk!" said Hurst; "no, that's quite a mistake; three glasses, I think
      it was, of champagne at supper; and you men have sat here drinking punch
      all the evening; if anybody's drunk, it's not me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurst's usually modest demeanour was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_100b" id="Page_100b">">[Pg 100]</a></span> so very much altered
      as to justify, in some measure, Leicester's supposition; but I really
      believe Flora Leicester's bright eyes had more to answer for in that
      matter than the champagne, whether the said three glasses were more or
      less.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as Horace's temper was evidently not improving, Miller, Fane, and
      myself wished him good night, and Hurst came with us. We got him into
      Fane's rooms, and then extracted from him a full history of the adventures
      of that delightful evening, to our infinite amusement, and apparently to
      his own immense satisfaction. It was evident that Miss Flora Leicester had
      made an impression, of which I do not give that young lady credit for
      being in the least unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression, however, like many others of its kind, soon wore off, I
      fancy; for the next time I saw Mr Wellington Hurst, he had returned to his
      usual frame of mind, and appeared quite modest and deferential; but it
      will not perhaps surprise my readers any more than it did myself, that
      Horace was never fond of referring to our drive to the steeple-chase at B&mdash;&mdash;,
      and did not appear to appreciate, as keenly as before, the trick we had
      played Hurst in leaving him behind; while all the after-reminiscences of
      the latter bore reference, whenever it was possible, to his favourite date&mdash;"That
      day when you and I and Leicester had that team to B&mdash;&mdash;
      together."

      It was the hour of sunrise. Not the gorgeous sunrise of Spain or Italy,
      when the horizon's ruddy blaze suddenly revives all that breathes, when
      golden rays mingle with the deep azure of a southern sky, and nature
      bursts into vitality and vigour, as if light gave life. The sun rose upon
      the chilly shores of Holland. The clouds opened to afford passage to a
      pale light, without heat or brilliancy. Nature passed insensibly from
      sleep to waking, but continued torpid when ceasing to slumber. No cry or
      joyous song, no flight of birds, or bleating of flocks, hail the advent of
      a new day. On the summit of the dykes, the reed-hedges bend before the
      breeze, and the sea-sand, whirled over the slight obstacle, falls upon the
      meadows, covering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2c" id="Page_2c">[Pg
      2]</a></span> their verdure with a moving veil. A river, yellow with the
      slime of its banks, flows peaceably and patiently towards the expectant
      ocean. Seen from afar, its waters and its shore appear of one colour,
      resembling a sandy plain; save where a ray of light, breaking upon the
      surface, reveals by silvery flashes the passage of the stream. Ponderous
      boats descend it, drawn by teams of horses, whose large feet sink into the
      sand as they advance leisurely and without distress to the goal of their
      journey. Behind them strides a peasant, whip on shoulder; he hurries not
      his cattle, he looks neither at the stream that flows, nor at the beasts
      that draw, nor at the boat that follows; he plods steadily onwards,
      trusting to perseverance to attain his end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is a corner of the picture presented to the traveller in Holland, the
      country charged, it would seem, more than any other, to enforce God's
      command to the waters, <i>Thou shalt go no farther!</i> This silent repose
      of creatures and things, this mild light, these neutral tints and vast
      motionless plains, are not without a certain poetry of their own. Wherever
      space and silence are united, poetry finds place; she loves all things
      more or less, whether smiling landscape or dreary desert; light of wing, a
      trifle will detain and support her&mdash;a blade of grass often suffices.
      And Holland, which Butler has called a large ship always at anchor, has
      its beauties for the thoughtful observer. Gradually<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_3c" id="Page_3c">[Pg 3]</a></span> one learns to admire this
      land at war with ocean and struggling daily for existence; those cities
      which compel the waters to flow at their ramparts' foot to follow the
      given track, and abide in the allotted bed; then those days of revolt,
      when the waves would fain reconquer their independence, when they
      overflow, and inundate, and destroy, and at last, constrained by the hand
      of man, subside and again obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sun rose, a small boat glided rapidly down the stream. It had a
      single occupant, a tall young man, lithe, skilful, and strong, who,
      although apparently in haste, kept near the shore, following the windings
      of the bank, and avoiding the centre of the current, which would have
      accelerated his progress. At that early hour the fields were deserted; the
      birds alone had risen earlier than the boatman, whose large hat of grey
      felt lay beside him, whilst his brown locks, tossed backward by the wind,
      disclosed regular features, a broad open forehead, and eyes somewhat
      thoughtful, like those of the men of the north. His costume denoted a
      student from a German university. One gathered from his extreme youth that
      his life had hitherto passed on academic benches, and that it was still a
      new and lively pleasure to him to feel the freshness of morning bathe his
      brow, the breeze play with his hair, the stream bear along his bark. He
      hastened, for there are times when we count the<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_4c" id="Page_4c">[Pg 4]</a></span> hours ill; when we outstrip
      and tax them with delay. Then, if we cannot hurry the pace of time, we
      prefer at least to wait at the appointed spot. It calms impatience, and
      seems a commencement of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the skiff had rounded a promontory of the bank, its speed increased,
      as if the eye directing it had gained sight of the goal. At a short
      distance the landscape changed its character. A meadow sloped down to the
      stream, fringed by a thick hedge of willows, half uprooted and bending
      over the water. The boat reached the shadow of the trees, and stopping
      there, rocked gently on the river, secured by a chain cast round a branch.
      The young man stood up and looked anxiously through the foliage; then he
      sang, in a low tone, the burthen of a ballad, a love-plaint, the national
      poetry of all countries. His voice, at first subdued, as if not to break
      too suddenly the surrounding silence, gradually rose as the song drew to a
      close. The clear mellow notes escaped from the bower of drooping leaves,
      and expired without echo or reply upon the surface of the pasture. Then he
      sat down and contemplated the peaceful picture presented to his view. The
      grey sky had that melancholy look so depressing to the joyless and
      hopeless; the cold dull water rolled noiselessly onward; to the left, the
      plain extended afar without variety of surface. A few windmills reared
      their gaunt arms, waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5c"
      id="Page_5c">[Pg 5]</a></span> for wind; and the wind, too weak to stir
      them, passed on and left them motionless. To the right, at the extremity
      of the little meadow, stood a square house of red bricks and regular
      construction, isolated, silent, and melancholy. The thick greenish glass
      of the windows refused to reflect the sunbeams; the roof supported gilded
      vanes of fantastical form; the garden was laid out in formal parterres. A
      few tulips, drooping their heavy heads, and dahlias, propped with white
      sticks, were the sole flowers growing there, and these were hemmed in and
      stifled by hedges of box. Trees, stunted and shabby, and with dust-covered
      leaves, were cut into walls and into various eccentric shapes. At the
      corners of the formal alleys, whose complicated windings were limited to a
      narrow space, stood a few plaster figures. One of these alleys led to the
      willow hedge. There nature resumed her rights; the willows grew free and
      unrestrained, stretching out from the land and drooping into the water;
      their inclined trunks forming flying-bridges, supported but at one end.
      The bank was high enough for a certain space to intervene between the
      stream and the horizontal stems. A few branches, longer than the rest,
      swept the surface of the river, and were kept in constant motion by its
      current.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath this dome of verdure the boat was moored, and there the young man
      mused, gazing at the sky&mdash;melancholy as his heart&mdash;and at the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6c" id="Page_6c">[Pg 6]</a></span> stream,
      in its course uncertain as his destiny. A few willow leaves fluttered
      against his brow, one of his hands hung in the water, a gentle breeze
      stirred his hair; nameless flowerets, blooming in the shelter of the
      trees, gave out a faint perfume, detectable at intervals, at the wind's
      caprice. A bird, hidden in the foliage, piped an amorous note, and the
      student, cradled in his skiff, awaited his love. Ungrateful that he was!
      he called time a laggard, and bid him speed; he was insensible to the
      charm of the present hour. Ah! if he grows old, how well will he
      understand that fortune then lavished on him the richest treasures of life&mdash;hope
      and youth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the student started, stood up, and, with outstretched neck, and
      eyes riveted on the trees, he listened, scarce daring to breathe. The
      foliage opened, and the face of a young girl was revealed to his gaze.
      "Christine!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine stepped upon the trunk of the lowest tree, and seated herself
      with address on this pliant bench, which her weight, slight as it was,
      caused to yield and rock. One of her hands, extended through the branches
      that drooped towards the water, reached that of her lover, who tenderly
      clasped it. Then she drew herself up again, and the tree, less loaded,
      seemed to obey her will by imitating her movement. The young man sat in
      his boat, with eyes uplifted towards the willow on which his love reposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7c" id="Page_7c">[Pg 7]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine Van Amberg had none of the distinguishing features of the
      country of her birth. Hair black as the raven's wing formed a frame to a
      face full of energy and expression. Her large eyes were dark and
      penetrating; her eyebrows, strongly marked and almost straight, would
      perhaps have imparted too decided a character to her young head, if a
      charming expression of candour and <i>naïveté</i> had not given her the
      countenance of a child rather than of a woman. Christine was fifteen years
      of age. A slender silver circlet bound her brow and jet-black tresses&mdash;a
      holiday ornament, according to her country's custom: but her greatest
      festival was the sight of her lover. She wore a simple muslin dress of a
      pale blue colour; a black silk mantle, intended to envelop her figure, was
      placed upon her hair, and fell back upon her shoulders, as if the better
      to screen her from the gaze of the curious. Seated on a tree trunk,
      surrounded by branches and beside the water, like Shakespeare's Ophelia,
      Christine was charming. But although young, beautiful, and beloved, deep
      melancholy was the characteristic of her features. Her companion, too,
      gazed mournfully at her, with eyes to which the tears seemed about to
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert," said the young girl, stooping towards her lover, "Herbert, be
      not so sad! we are both too young to despair of life. Herbert! better
      times will come."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8c" id="Page_8c">[Pg 8]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine! they have refused me your hand, expelled me your dwelling;
      they would separate us entirely: they will succeed, to-morrow perhaps!..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" exclaimed the young girl, with a glance like the lightning's
      flash. But, like that flash, the expression of energy was momentary, and
      gave way to one of calm melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you would, Christine, if you would! ... how easy were it to fly
      together, to unite our destinies on a foreign shore, and to live for each
      other, happy and forgotten!... I will lead you to those glorious lands
      where the sun shines as you see it in your dreams&mdash;to the summit of
      lofty mountains whence the eye discovers a boundless horizon&mdash;to
      noble forests with their thousand tints of green, where the fresh breeze
      shall quicken your cheek, and sweep from your memory these fogs, this
      humid clime, these monotonous plains. Our days shall pass blissfully in a
      country worthy of our loves."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Herbert spoke, the young girl grew animated; she seemed to see what he
      described, her eager eye sought the horizon as though she would over-leap
      it, her lips parted as to inhale the mountain breeze. Then she passed her
      hand hastily across her eyes, and sighed deeply. "No!" she exclaimed; "no,
      I must remain here!... Herbert, it is my country: why does it make me
      suffer? I remember another sky, another land,&mdash;but<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9c" id="Page_9c">[Pg 9]</a></span> no, it is
      a dream! I was born here, and have scarcely passed the boundary of this
      meadow. My mother sang too often beside my cradle the ballads and boleros
      of her native Seville; she told me too much of Spain, and I love that
      unknown land as one pines after an absent friend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl glanced at the river, over which a dense fog was spreading.
      A few rain-drops pattered amongst the leaves; she crossed her mantle on
      her breast, and her whole frame shivered with sudden chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me, Christine, you suffer!&mdash;return home, and, since you reject
      my roof and hearth, abide with those who can shelter and warm you."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sweet smile played upon Christine's lips. "My beloved," she said, "near
      you I prefer the chilling rain, this rough branch, and the biting wind, to
      my seat in the house, far from you, beside the blazing chimney. Ah! with
      what joy and confidence would I start on foot for the farthest corner of
      the earth, your arm my sole support, your love my only wealth. But...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What retains you, Christine? your father's affection, your sisters'
      tenderness, your happy home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl grew pale. "Herbert, it is cruel to speak thus. Well do I
      know that my father loves me not, that my sisters are often unkind, that
      my home is unhappy; I know it, indeed I know it, and I will follow you....
      If my mother consents!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10c" id="Page_10c">[Pg 10]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked at his mistress with astonishment. "Child!" he exclaimed,
      "such consent will never leave your mother's lips. There are cases where
      strength and resolution must be found in one's own heart. Your mother will
      never say yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps!" replied Christine, slowly and gravely. "My mother loves me; I
      resemble her in most things, and her heart understands mine. She knows
      that Scripture says a woman shall leave her father and mother to follow
      her husband; she is in the secret of our attachment, and, since our door
      has been closed against you, I have not shed a tear that she has not
      detected and replied to by another. You misjudge my mother, Herbert!
      Something tells me she has suffered, and knows that a little happiness is
      essential to life as the air we breathe. Nor would it surprise me, if one
      day, when embracing me, as she does each night when we are alone, she were
      to whisper: Begone, my poor child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot think it, Christine. She will bid you obey, be comforted,
      forget!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forget! Herbert, my mother forgets nothing. To forget is the resource of
      cowardly hearts. No,&mdash;none will bid me forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      And once more a gloomy fire flashed in Christine's eyes, like the rapid
      passage of a flame which illumines and instantly expires. It was a
      revelation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11c" id="Page_11c">[Pg 11]</a></span>
      of the future rather than the expression of the present. An ardent soul
      dwelt within her, but had not yet cast off all the encumbrances of
      childhood. It struggled to make its way, and at times, succeeding for a
      moment, a word or cry revealed its presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I shall not forget," added Christine; "I love you, and you love
      me, who am so little loved! You find me neither foolish, nor fantastical,
      nor capricious; you understand my reveries and the thousand strange
      thoughts that invade my heart. I am very young, Herbert; and yet, here,
      with my hand in yours, I answer for the future. I shall always love you!
      ... and see, I do not weep. I have faith in the happiness of our love;
      how? when? I know not,&mdash;it is the secret of my Creator, who would not
      have sent me upon earth only to suffer. Happiness will come when He deems
      right, but come it will! Yes,&mdash;I am young, full of life, I have need
      of air and space; I shall not live enclosed and smothered here. The world
      is large, and I will know it; my heart is full of love, and will love for
      ever. No tears, dearest! obstacles shall be overcome, they must give way,
      for I will be happy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why delay, Christine? My love! my wife! an opportunity lost may never
      be regained. A minute often decides the fate of a lifetime. Perhaps, at
      this very moment, happiness is near us! A leap into my boat, a few strokes
      of the oar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12c" id="Page_12c">[Pg
      12]</a></span> we are united for ever!... Perhaps, if you again return to
      land, we are for ever separated. Christine, come! The wind rises: beneath
      my feet is a sail that will quickly swell and bear us away rapidly as the
      wings of yon bird."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears flowed fast over Christine's burning cheeks. She shuddered, looked
      at her lover, at the horizon, thought of liberty; she hesitated, and a
      violent struggle agitated her soul. At last, hiding her face amongst the
      leafage of the willow, she clasped her arms round its stem, as if to
      withhold herself from entering the boat, and in a stifled voice muttered
      the words,&mdash;"My mother!" A few seconds afterwards, she raised her
      pallid countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I fled," said she gently, "to whom would my mother speak of her dear
      country? Who would weep with her when she weeps, if I were gone? She has
      other children, but they are gay and happy, and do not resemble her. Only
      my mother and myself are sad in our house. My mother would die of my
      absence. I must receive her farewell blessing or remain by her side,
      chilled like her by this inclement climate, imprisoned in yonder walls,
      ill-treated by those who love me not. Herbert, I will not fly, I will
      wait!" And she made a movement to regain the strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One instant,&mdash;yet one second,&mdash;Christine! I know not what
      chilling presentiment oppresses my heart. Dearest,&mdash;if we were to
      meet no more! If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13c" id="Page_13c">[Pg
      13]</a></span> this little corner of earth were our last trysting-place&mdash;these
      melancholy willows the witnesses of our eternal separation! Is it&mdash;can
      it be&mdash;the last happy hour of my life that has just slipped by?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He covered his face with his hands, to conceal his tears. Christine's
      heart beat violently&mdash;but she had courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letting herself drop from the tree, she stood upon the bank, separated
      from the boat, which could not come nearer to shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, Herbert!" said she, "one day I will be your wife, faithful and
      loving. It shall be, for I will have it so. Let us both pray God to hasten
      that happy day. Adieu, I love you! Adieu, and till our next meeting, for I
      love you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrier of reeds and willows opened before the young girl. A few small
      branches crackled beneath her tread; there was a slight noise in the grass
      and bushes, as when a bird takes flight; then all was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert wept.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      The clock in the red brick house struck eight, and the family of Van
      Amberg the merchant were mustered in the breakfast-room. Christine was the
      only absentee. Near the fire stood the head of the family&mdash;Karl Van
      Amberg&mdash;and beside him his brother, who, older than himself, yielded
      the prerogative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14c" id="Page_14c">[Pg
      14]</a></span> of seniority, and left him master of the community. Madame
      Van Amberg was working near a window, and her two elder daughters,
      fair-haired, white-skinned Dutchwomen, prepared the breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl Van Amberg, the dreaded chief of this family, was of lofty stature;
      his gait was stiff; his physiognomy passionless. His face, whose features
      at first appeared insignificant, denoted a domineering temper. His manners
      were cold. He spoke little; never to praise, but often in terms of dry and
      imperious censure. His glance preceded his words and rendered them nearly
      superfluous, so energetically could that small sunken grey eye make itself
      understood. With the sole aid of his own patience and ambition, Karl Van
      Amberg had made a large fortune. His ships covered the seas. Never loved,
      always respected, his credit was everywhere excellent. Absolute monarch in
      his own house, none dreamed of opposing his will. All were mute and awed
      in his presence. At this moment, he was leaning against the chimney-piece.
      His black garments were very plain, but not devoid of a certain austere
      elegance.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Van Amberg, Karl's brother, was quite of an opposite character. He
      would have passed his life in poverty, subsisting on the scanty income
      left him by his parents, had not Karl desired wealth. He placed his modest
      fortune in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15c" id="Page_15c">[Pg
      15]</a></span> brother's hands, saying, "Act as for yourself!" Attached to
      his native nook of land, he lived in peace, smoking and smiling, and
      learning from time to time that he was a richer man by a few hundred
      thousand francs. One day, he was told that he possessed a million; in
      reply, he merely wrote, "Thanks, Karl; it will be for your children." Then
      he forgot his riches, and changed nothing in his manner of life, even
      adhering in his dress to the coarse materials and graceless fashion of a
      peasant dreading the vicinity of cities. His youthful studies had
      consisted of a course of theology. His father, a fervent Catholic,
      destined him for the church; but it came to pass, as a consequence of his
      indecision of character, that William neither took orders nor married, but
      lived quietly in his brother's family. The habitual perusal of religious
      books sometimes gave his language a mystical tone, contrasting with the
      rustic simplicity of his exterior. This was his only peculiarity;
      otherwise he had nothing remarkable but his warm heart and strong good
      sense. He was the primitive type of his family: his brother was an example
      of the change caused by newly-acquired wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Van Amberg, seated at the window, sewed in silence. Her countenance
      had the remains of great beauty, but she was weak and suffering. A single
      glance sufficed to fix her birthplace far from Holland. Her black hair and
      olive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16c" id="Page_16c">[Pg 16]</a></span>
      tint betrayed a southern origin. Silently submissive to her husband, his
      iron character had pressed heavily upon this delicate creature. She had
      never murmured; now she was dying, but without complaint. Her look was one
      of deep melancholy. Christine, her third daughter, resembled her. Of dark
      complexion, like her mother, she contrasted strongly with her rosy-cheeked
      sisters. M. Van Amberg did not love Christine. Rough and cold, even to
      those he secretly cherished, he was severe and cruel to those he disliked.
      He had never been known to kiss Christine. Her mother's were the only
      caresses she knew, and even those were stealthily and tearfully bestowed.
      The two poor women hid themselves to love each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At intervals, Madame Van Amberg coughed painfully. The damp climate of
      Holland was slowly conducting to her grave the daughter of Spain's ardent
      land. Her large melancholy eyes mechanically sought the monotonous
      horizon, which had bounded her view for twenty years. Fog and rain
      surrounded the house. She gazed, shivered as if seized with deadly cold,
      then resumed her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight o'clock had just struck, and the two young Dutchwomen, who, although
      rich heiresses, waited upon their father, had just placed the tea and
      smoked beef upon the table, when Karl Van Amberg turned abruptly to his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17c" id="Page_17c">[Pg 17]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is your daughter, madam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke of Christine, whom the restless gaze of Madame Van Amberg vainly
      sought through the fog veiling the garden. At her husband's question, the
      lady rose, opened the door, and, leaning on the banister, twice uttered
      her daughter's name. There was no reply; she grew pale, and again looked
      out anxiously through the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go in, Madame," was the surly injunction of Gothon, the old servant
      woman, who knelt on the hall flags, which she had flooded with soap and
      water, and was now vigorously scrubbing,&mdash;"Go, in, Madame; the damp
      increases your cough, and Mademoiselle Christine is far enough away! The
      bird flew before daybreak."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Van Amberg cast a mournful glance across the meadow, where nothing
      moved, and into the parlour, where her stern husband awaited her; then she
      went in and sat down at the table, around which the remainder of the
      family had already placed themselves. No one spoke. All could read
      displeasure upon M. Van Amberg's countenance, and none dared attempt to
      change the course of his ideas. His wife kept her eyes fixed upon the
      window, hoping her daughter's return. Her lips scarcely tasted the milk
      that filled her cup; visible anguish increased the paleness of her sweet,
      sad countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Annunciata, my dear, take some tea," said her<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_18c" id="Page_18c">[Pg 18]</a></span> brother-in-law. "The day
      is chill and damp, and you seem to suffer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Annunciata smiled sadly at William. For sole answer she raised to her lips
      the tea he offered her, but the effort was too painful, and she replaced
      the cup upon the table. M. Van Amberg looked at nobody; he ate, his eyes
      fixed upon his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sister," resumed William, "it is a duty to care for one's health, and
      you, who fulfil all your duties, should not neglect that one."
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight flush tinged the brow of Annunciata. Her eyes encountered those
      of her husband, which he slowly turned towards her. Trembling, almost
      weeping, she ceased her attempts to eat. And the silence was again
      unbroken, as at the commencement of the meal. At last steps were heard in
      the passage, the old servant grumbled something which did not reach the
      parlour, then the door opened, and Christine entered; her muslin dress
      damp with fog, her graceful curls disordered by the wind, her black mantle
      glittering with a thousand little rain-drops. She was crimson with
      embarrassment and fear. Her empty chair was beside her mother; she sat
      down, and hung her head; none offered aught to the truant child, and the
      silence continued. Yielding to maternal anxiety, Madame Van Amberg took a
      handkerchief and wiped the moisture from Christine's forehead and hair;
      then she took her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19c" id="Page_19c">[Pg
      19]</a></span> hands to warm them in her own. For the second time M. Van
      Amberg looked at his wife. She let Christine's hands fall, and remained
      downcast and motionless as her daughter. M. Van Amberg rose from table. A
      tear glistened in the mother's eyes on seeing that her daughter had not
      eaten. But she said nothing, and returning to the window, resumed her
      sewing. Christine remained at table, preserving her frightened and abashed
      attitude. The two eldest girls hastened to remove the breakfast things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not see what Wilhelmina and Maria are about? Can you not help
      them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At her father's voice, Christine hastily rose, seized the cups and teapot,
      and hurried to and fro from parlour to pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gently! You will break something!" cried M. Van Amberg. "Begin in time,
      to finish without hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine stood still in the middle of the room. Her two sisters smiled as
      they passed her, and one of them muttered&mdash;for nobody spoke aloud in
      M. Van Amberg's presence&mdash;"Christine will hardly learn housekeeping
      by looking at the stars and watching the river flow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then, Mademoiselle, you are spoiling everything here!" said the old
      servant, who had just come in; "go and change that wet gown, which ruins
      all my furniture."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20c" id="Page_20c">[Pg 20]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine remained where she was, not daring to stir without the master's
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go," said M. Van Amberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl darted from the room and up the stairs, reached her
      chamber, threw herself upon the bed and burst into tears. Below, Madame
      Van Amberg continued to sew, her head bent over her work. When the cloth
      was removed, Wilhelmina and Maria placed a large jug of beer, glasses,
      long pipes, and a store of tobacco, upon the mahogany table, and pushed
      forward two arm-chairs, in which Karl and William installed themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Retire to your apartment, madam," said M. Van Amberg, in the imperious
      tone habitual to him when he addressed his wife,&mdash;"I have to discuss
      matters which do not concern you. Do not leave the house; I will call you
      by-and-by; I wish to speak with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Annunciata bowed in token of obedience, and left the room. Wilhelmina and
      Maria approached their father, who silently kissed their pretty cheeks.
      The two brothers lit their pipes, and remained alone. William was the
      first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother Karl!" said he, resting his arms upon the table, and looking M.
      Van Amberg in the face, "before proceeding to business, and at risk of
      offending you, I must relieve my heart. Here, all fear you, and counsel,
      the salutary support of man, is denied you."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21c" id="Page_21c">[Pg 21]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak, William," coldly replied M. Van Amberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Karl, you treat Annunciata very harshly. God commands you to protect her,
      and you allow her to suffer, perhaps to die, before your eyes, without
      caring for her fate. The strong should sustain the weak. In our native
      land, we owe kindness to the stranger who cometh from afar. The husband
      owes protection to her he has chosen for his wife. For all these reasons,
      brother, I say you treat Annunciata ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she complain?" said M. Van Amberg, filling his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, brother; only the strong resist and complain. A tree falls with a
      crash, the reed bends noiselessly to the ground. No, she does not
      complain, save by silence and suffering, by constant and passive
      obedience, like that of a soulless automaton. You have deprived her of
      life, the poor woman! One day she will cease to move and breathe; she has
      long ceased to live!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother, there are words that should not be inconsiderately spoken,
      judgments that should not be hastily passed, for fear of injustice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I not know your whole life, Karl, as well as my own, and can I not
      therefore speak confidently, as one well informed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg inhaled the smoke of his pipe, threw himself back in his
      arm-chair, and made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22c" id="Page_22c">[Pg 22]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you as I know myself," resumed William, gently, "although our
      hearts were made to love and not to resemble each other. When you found
      our father's humble dwelling too small, I said nothing; you were
      ambitious; when a man is born with that misfortune or blessing, he must do
      like the birds, who have wings to soar; he must strive to rise. You
      departed; I pressed your hand, and reproached you not; it is right that
      each man should be happy his own way. You gained much gold, and gave me
      more than I needed. You returned married, and I did not approve your
      marriage. It is wiser to seek a companion in the land where one's days are
      to end; it is something to love the same places and things, and then it is
      only generous to leave one's wife a family, friends, well-known objects to
      gaze upon. It is counting greatly on one's-self to take sole charge of her
      happiness. Happiness sometimes consists of so many things! Often an
      imperceptible atom serves as base to its vast structure: for my part I do
      not like presumptuous experiments on the hearts of others. In short, you
      married a foreigner, who perishes with cold in this country, and sighs,
      amidst our fogs, for the sun of Spain. You committed a still greater fault&mdash;Forgive
      me, brother; I speak plainly, in order not to return to this subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am attending to you, William; you are my elder brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23c" id="Page_23c">[Pg 23]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks for your patience, Karl. No longer young, you married a very young
      woman. Your affairs took you to Spain. There you met a needy Spanish
      noble, to whom you rendered a weighty service. You were always generous,
      and increasing wealth did not close your hand. This noble had a daughter,
      a child of fifteen. In spite of your apparent coldness, you were smitten
      by her beauty, and you asked her of her father. Only one thing struck you&mdash;that
      she was poor and would be enriched by the marriage. A refusal of your
      offer would have been ingratitude to a benefactor. They gave you
      Annunciata, and you took her, brother, without looking whether joy was in
      her eyes, without asking the child whether she willingly followed you,
      without interrogating her heart. In that country the heart is precocious
      in its awakening ... perhaps she left behind her some youthful dream ...
      some early love.... Forgive me, Karl; the subject is difficult to
      discuss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Change it, William," said M. Van Amberg, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so. You returned hither, and when your business again took you
      forth upon the ocean, you left Annunciata to my care. She lived many years
      with me in this house. Karl, her youth was joyless and sad. Isolated and
      silent, she wore out her days without pleasure or variety. Your two eldest
      daughters, now the life of our dwelling, were then<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_24c" id="Page_24c">[Pg 24]</a></span> in the cradle. They were
      no society to their mother; I was a very grave companion for that young
      and beautiful creature. I have little reading and knowledge, no
      imagination; I like my quiet arm-chair, my old books, and my pipe. I at
      first allowed myself to believe&mdash;because I loved to believe it&mdash;that
      Annunciata resembled me&mdash;that tranquillity and a comfortable dwelling
      would suffice for her happiness, as they sufficed for mine. But at last I
      understood&mdash;what you, brother, I fear, have never comprehended&mdash;that
      she was not born to be a Dutch housewife. In the first place, the climate
      tortured her. She constantly asked me if finer summers would not come,&mdash;if
      the winters were always so rigorous,&mdash;the fogs so frequent. I told
      her no, that the year was a bad one; but I told her a falsehood, for the
      winters were always the same. At first she tried to sing her Sevillian
      romances and boleros, but soon her song died away and she wept, for it
      reminded her too much of her own native land. Silent and motionless she
      sat, desiring, as I have read in the Bible,&mdash;'The wings of the dove
      to fly away and be at rest.' Brother, it was a melancholy sight. You know
      not how slowly the winter evenings passed in this parlour. It was dark at
      four, and she worked by lamp-light till bed-time. I endeavoured to
      converse, but she knew nothing of the things I knew, and I was ignorant of
      those that interested her. I saw at last that the greatest kindness was to
      leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25c" id="Page_25c">[Pg 25]</a></span>
      her to herself. She worked or was idle, wept or was calm, and I averted my
      eyes to give her the only consolation in my power,&mdash;a little liberty.
      But it was very sad, brother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence, broken by M. Van Amberg. "Madame Van Amberg
      was in her own dwelling," said he, severely, "with her children, and under
      the protection of a devoted friend. Her husband toiled in foreign parts to
      increase the fortune of the family; she remained at home to keep house and
      educate her daughters; all that is very natural." And he filled his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," replied William; "but still she was unhappy. Was it a crime? God
      will decide. Leave her to His justice, Karl, and let us be merciful!
      During your long absence, chance conducted hither some Spaniards whom
      Annunciata had known in her childhood, and amongst them the son of an old
      friend of her father's. Oh! with what mingled joy and agitation did the
      dear child welcome her countrymen! What tears she shed in the midst of her
      joy ... for she had forgotten how to be happy, and every emotion made her
      weep. How eagerly she heard and spoke her native tongue! She fancied
      herself again in Spain; for a while she was almost happy. You returned,
      brother, and you were cruel; one day, without explaining your motives, you
      shut your door upon the strangers. Tell me, why would you not allow
      fellow-countrymen, friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26c"
      id="Page_26c">[Pg 26]</a></span> a companion of her childhood, to speak to
      your wife of her family and native land? Why require complete isolation,
      and a total rupture with old friends? She obeyed without a murmur, but she
      suffered more than you thought. I watched her closely; I, her old friend.
      Since that fresh proof of your rigour, she is sadder than before. A third
      time she became a mother; it was in vain; her unhappiness continued.
      Brother, your hand has been too heavy on this feeble creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg rose, and slowly paced the room. "Have you finished,
      William?" said he; "this conversation is painful, let it end here; do not
      abuse the license I give you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I have yet more to say. You are a cold and severe husband, but that
      is not all; you are also an unjust father. Christine, your third daughter,
      is denied her share of your affection, and by this partiality you further
      wound the heart of Annunciata. Christine resembles her; she is what I can
      fancy her mother at fifteen&mdash;a lively and charming Spaniard; she has
      all her mother's tastes; like her she lives with difficulty in our
      climate, and although born in it, by a caprice of nature she suffers from
      it as Annunciata suffered. Brother, the child is not easy to manage;
      independent, impassioned, violent in all her impressions, she has a love
      of movement and liberty which ill agrees with our regular habits, but she
      has also a good heart, and by appealing to it<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_27c" id="Page_27c">[Pg 27]</a></span> you might perhaps have
      tamed her wild spirit. For Christine you are neither more nor less than a
      pitiless judge. Her childhood was one long grief. And thus, far from
      losing her wild restlessness, she loves more than ever to be abroad and at
      liberty; she goes out at daybreak; she looks upon the house as a cage
      whose bars hurt her, and you vainly endeavour to restrain her. Brother, if
      you would have obedience, show affection. It is a power that succeeds when
      all others fail. Why prevent her marrying the man she loves? Herbert the
      student is not rich, nor is his alliance brilliant; but they love each
      other!"
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg, who had continued his walk, now stopped short, and coldly
      replied to his brother's accusations: "Christine is only fifteen, and I do
      my duty by curbing the foolish passion that prematurely disturbs her
      reason. As to what you call my partiality, you have explained it yourself
      by the defects of her character. You, who reproach others as pitiless
      judges, beware yourself of judging too severely. Every man acts according
      to his internal perceptions, and all things are not good to be spoken.
      Empty your glass, William, and if you have finished your pipe, do not
      begin another. The business I had to discuss with you will keep till
      another day; it is late, and I am tired. It is not always wise to rake up
      the memories of the past. I wish to be alone a while. Leave me, and tell
      Madame Van Amberg to come to me in a quarter of an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28c" id="Page_28c">[Pg 28]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not say, 'Tell Annunciata?' Why, for so long a time, has that strange
      sweet name never passed your lips?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell Madame Van Amberg I would speak with her, and leave me, brother,"
      replied Karl sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      William felt he had pushed Karl Van Amberg's patience to its utmost limit;
      he got up and left the room. At the foot of the stairs he hesitated a
      moment, then ascended, and sought Annunciata in Christine's chamber. It
      was a narrow cell, shining with cleanliness, and containing a few flowers
      in glasses, a wooden crucifix, with chaplets of beads hanging on it, and a
      snow-white bed; a guitar (it was her mother's) was suspended on the wall.
      From the window was seen the meadow, the river, and the willows. Christine
      sat on the foot of the bed, still weeping; her mother was beside her,
      offering her bread and milk, with which Christine's tears mingled.
      Annunciata kissed her daughter's eyes, and then furtively wiped her own.
      On entering, William stood for a few moments at the door, mournfully
      contemplating this touching picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My brother, my good brother," cried Annunciata, "speak to my child! She
      has forgotten prayer and obedience; her heart is no longer submissive, and
      her tears avail nothing, for she murmurs and menaces. Ask her, brother, by
      whom it was told her that life is joy? that we live only to be happy?<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29c" id="Page_29c">[Pg 29]</a></span> Talk
      to her of duty, and give her strength to accomplish it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your husband inquires for you, sister. Go, I will remain with Christine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I go, my brother," replied Annunciata. Approaching the little mirror
      above the chimney-piece, she washed the tear-stains from her eyes, pressed
      her hand upon her heart to check its throbbings, and when her countenance
      had resumed its expression of calm composure, she descended the stairs.
      Gothon was seated on the lower steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You spoil her, madame," said she roughly to her mistress; "foolish ears
      need sharp words. You spoil her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gothon had been in the house before Annunciata, and had been greatly
      displeased by the arrival of her master's foreign lady, whose authority
      she never acknowledged. But she had served the Van Ambergs' mother, and
      therefore it was without fear of dismissal that she oppressed, after her
      own fashion, her timid and gentle mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annunciata entered the parlour and remained standing near the door as if
      waiting an order. Her husband's countenance was graver and more gloomy
      than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can no one hear us, madam? Are you sure we are alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite alone, sir," replied the astonished Annunciata.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30c" id="Page_30c">[Pg 30]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg recommenced his walk. For some moments he said nothing. His
      wife, her hand resting on the back of an arm-chair, silently awaited his
      pleasure. At last he again spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bring up your daughter Christine badly; I left her to your care and
      guidance, and you do not watch over her. Do you know where she goes and
      what she does?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From her childhood, sir," replied Annunciata gently, pausing between each
      phrase, "Christine has loved to live in the open air. She is delicate, and
      requires sun and liberty to strengthen her. Till now you have allowed her
      to live thus; I saw no harm in letting her follow her natural bent. If you
      disapprove, sir, she will obey your orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bring up your daughter badly," coldly repeated M. Van Amberg. "She
      will dishonour the name she bears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!!" exclaimed Annunciata, her cheeks suffused with the deepest
      crimson; her eyes emitting a momentary but vivid flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look to it, madam, I will have my name respected, that you know! You also
      know I am informed of whatever passes in my house. Your daughter secretly
      meets a man to whom I refused her hand; this morning, at six o'clock, they
      were together on the river bank!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter! my daughter!" cried Annunciata in disconsolate tones. "Oh!
      it is impossible!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31c" id="Page_31c">[Pg
      31]</a></span> She is innocent! she shall remain so! I will place myself
      between her and evil, I will save my child! I will take her in my arms,
      and close her ears to dangerous words. My daughter, I will say, remain
      innocent, remain honoured, if you would not see me die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With unmoved eye M. Van Amberg beheld the mother's emotion. Beneath his
      frozen gaze, Annunciata felt embarrassed by her own agitation; she made an
      effort to calm herself; then, with clasped hands, and eyes filled with
      tears, which she would not allow to flow, she resumed, in a constrained
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this beyond doubt, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," replied M. Van Amberg: "I never accuse without certainty."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence. M. Van Amberg again spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will lock Christine in her room, and bring me the key. She will have
      time to reflect, and I trust reflection will be of service to her; in a
      prolonged seclusion she will lose that love of motion and liberty which
      leads her into harm; the silence of complete solitude will allay the
      tumult of her thoughts. None shall enter her room, save Gothon, who shall
      take her her meals, and return me the key. This is what I have decided
      upon as proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Van Amberg's lips opened several times to speak, but her courage
      failed her. At last she advanced a pace or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32c" id="Page_32c">[Pg 32]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I, sir, I," said she in a stifled voice, "<i>I</i> am to see my
      child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said no one," replied M. Van Amberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she will despair, if none sustain her. I will be severe with her; you
      may be assured I will! Let me see her, if only once a-day. She may fall
      ill of grief, and who will know it? Gothon dislikes her. For pity's sake,
      let me see Christine! For a minute only, a single minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg once more stood still, and fixed upon his wife a look that
      made her stagger. "Not another word!" he said. "I allow no discussion,
      madam. No one shall see Christine; do you hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will obey," replied Annunciata.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Convey my orders to your daughter. At dinner bring me the key of her
      room. Go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Van Amberg found Christine alone, seated on her bed, and exhausted
      by long weeping. Her beautiful face, at times so energetic, wore an
      expression of profound and touching dejection. Her long hair fell in
      disorder on her shoulders, her figure was bent, as if weighed down by
      grief: her rosary had fallen from her half-open hand; she had tried to
      obey her mother and to pray, but had been able only to weep. Her black
      mantle, still damp with rain, lay upon a table, a few willow sprays
      peeping from its silken folds. Christine eyed them with mingled love and
      melancholy. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33c" id="Page_33c">[Pg
      33]</a></span> thought it a century since she saw the sun rise on the
      river, on the old trees, and on Herbert's skiff. Her mother slowly
      approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My child," said she, "where were you at daybreak this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine raised her eyes to her mother's face, looked at her, but did not
      answer. Annunciata repeated her question without change of word or tone.
      Then Christine let herself slide from the bed to the ground, and kneeled
      before her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was seated," she said, "upon the trunk of a willow that overhangs the
      stream. I was near Herbert's boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine!" exclaimed Madame Van Amberg, "can it be true? Oh, my child,
      could you so infringe the commands laid upon you! Could you thus forget my
      lessons and advice! Christine, you thought not of me when you committed
      that fault!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert said to me, 'Come, you shall be my wife, I will love you
      eternally, you shall be free and happy; all is ready for our marriage and
      our flight; come!' I replied, 'I will not leave my mother!' Mother, you
      have been my safeguard; if it be a crime to follow Herbert, it is the
      thought of you alone that prevented my committing it. I would not leave my
      mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A beam of joy illumined Annunciata's countenance. Murmuring a thanksgiving
      to God, she raised her kneeling child and seated her by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34c" id="Page_34c">[Pg 34]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak to me, Christine," she said, "open your heart, and tell me all your
      thoughts. Together we will regret your faults, and seek hope for the
      future. Speak, my daughter; conceal nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine laid her head upon her mother's shoulder, put one of her little
      hands in hers, sighed deeply, as though her heart were too oppressed for
      words, and spoke at last with effort and fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," she said, "I have nothing to confess that you do not already
      know. I love Herbert. He is but a poor student, intrusted to my father's
      care, but he has a noble heart&mdash;like mine, somewhat sad. He knows
      much, and he is gentle to those who know nothing. Poor, he is proud as a
      king: he loves, and he tells it only to her who knows it. My mother, I
      love Herbert! He asked my hand of my father, whose reply was a smile of
      scorn. Then he was kept from me, and I tried to exist without seeing him.
      I could not do it. I made many <i>neuvaines</i> on the rosary you gave me.
      I had seen you weep and pray, mother, and I said to myself&mdash;Now that
      I weep as she does, I must also pray like her. But it happened once, as
      day broke, that I saw a small boat descend the stream, then go up again,
      and again descend; from time to time a white sail fluttered in the air as
      one flutters a kerchief to a departing friend. My thoughts, then as now,
      were on Herbert; I ran across the meadow&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_35c" id="Page_35c">[Pg 35]</a></span> reached the stream&mdash;Mother,
      it was he! hoping and waiting my coming. Long and mournfully we bewailed
      our separation; fervently we vowed to love until death. This morning
      Herbert, discouraged and weary of waiting a change in our position, urged
      me to fly with him. I might have fled, mother, but I thought of you and
      remained. I have told you all; if I have done wrong, forgive me, dearest
      mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With deep emotion Madame Van Amberg listened to her daughter, and remained
      buried in reflection, when Christine paused. She felt that the young
      girl's suffering heart needed gentle lessons, affectionate advice; and,
      instead of these, she was the bearer of a sentence whose severity must
      aggravate the evil&mdash;she was compelled to deny her sick child the
      remedies that might have saved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You love him very dearly, then," said she at last, fixing a long
      melancholy look on her daughter's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother!" exclaimed Christine, "I love him with all my soul! My life
      is passed in expecting, seeing, remembering him! I could never make you
      understand how entirely my heart is his. Often I dream of dying for him,
      not to save his life, that were too easy and natural, but uselessly at his
      command."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! Christine, hush! you frighten me," cried Annunciata, placing both
      hands upon her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36c" id="Page_36c">[Pg
      36]</a></span> daughter's mouth. By a quick movement Christine disengaged
      herself from her mother's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" she exclaimed, "you know not what it is to love as I do! My father
      could never let himself be loved thus!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be silent, my child! be silent!" repeated Annunciata energetically. "Oh,
      my daughter! how to instil into your heart thoughts of peace and duty!
      Almighty Father! bless my weak words, that they may touch her soul!
      Christine, hear me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Annunciata took her daughter's hands, and compelled her to stand before
      her. "My child," she said, "you know nothing of life; you walk at random,
      and are about to wander from the right path. All young hearts have been
      troubled as yours is now. The noble ones have struggled and triumphed; the
      others have fallen! Life is no easy and pleasant passage; its trials are
      many and painful&mdash;its struggles severe; believe me, for us women
      there is no true happiness beyond the bounds of duty. And when happiness
      is not our destiny, many great things still remain to us. Honour, the
      esteem of others, are not mere empty words. Hear me, beloved child! That
      God whom from your infancy I have taught you to love, do you not fear
      offending him? Seek Him, and you will find better consolation than I can
      offer. Christine, we love in God those from whom we are severed on earth.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37c" id="Page_37c">[Pg 37]</a></span> He,
      who in his infinite wisdom imposed so many fetters on the heart of woman,
      foresaw the sacrifices they would entail, and surely he has kept treasures
      of love for hearts that break in obedience to duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Annunciata rapidly wiped the tears inundating her fine countenance; then
      clasping Christine's arm&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "On your knees, my child! on our knees both of us before the Christ I gave
      you! 'Tis nearly dark, and yet we still discern Him&mdash;his arms seeming
      to open for us. Bless and save and console my child, oh merciful God!
      Appease her heart; make it humble and obedient!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her prayer at an end, she rose, and throwing her arms round Christine, who
      had passively allowed herself to be placed on her knees and lifted up
      again, she embraced her tenderly, pressed her to her heart, and bathed her
      hair with tears. "My daughter," she murmured between her kisses, "my
      daughter, speak to me! Utter one word that I may take with me as a hope!
      My child, will you not speak to your mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, I love Herbert!" was Christine's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annunciata looked despairingly at her child, at the crucifix upon the
      wall, at the darkening sky seen through the open window. The dinner-bell
      rang. Madame Van Amberg made a strong effort to collect and express her
      ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38c" id="Page_38c">[Pg 38]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Van Amberg," said she in broken voice, "orders you to remain in your
      room. I am to take him the key. You are to see no one. The hour is come,
      and he expects me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A prisoner!" cried Christine; "A prisoner,&mdash;alone, all day! Death
      rather than that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will have it so," repeated Annunciata mournfully; "I must obey. He
      will have it so." And she approached the door, casting upon Christine a
      look of such ineffable love and grief, that the young girl, fascinated by
      the gaze, let her depart without opposition. The key turned in the lock,
      and Annunciata, supporting herself by the banister, slowly descended. She
      found M. Van Amberg alone in the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been a long time up stairs," said he. "Have you convinced
      yourself that your daughter saw the student Herbert this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did," murmured Annunciata.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have told her my orders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the key?" She gave it him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now to dinner," said M. Van Amberg, walking into the dining-room.
      Annunciata endeavoured to follow him, but her strength failed her, and she
      sank upon a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg sat down alone to his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39c" id="Page_39c">[Pg 39]</a></span>
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      "A prisoner!" repeated Christine in her solitude; "apart from all! shut
      up! Yon meadow was too wide a range; the house too spacious a prison. I
      must have a narrower cell, with more visible walls&mdash;a straiter
      captivity! They deprive me of the little air I breathed&mdash;the scanty
      liberty I found means to enjoy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the window to its full extent; leaned upon the sill, and looked
      at the sky. It was very dark; heavy clouds hid the stars; no light fell
      upon the earth; different shades of obscurity alone marked the outlines of
      objects. The willows, so beautiful when Herbert and the sun were there,
      were now a black and motionless mass; dead silence reigned around. In view
      of nature thus lifeless and lightless, hopes of happiness could hardly
      enter the heart. Christine was in a fever: she felt oppressed and crushed
      by unkindly influences, by the indifference of friends, by a tyrant's
      will, even by the cold and mournful night. The young girl's heart beat
      quickly and rebelliously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so!" she exclaimed aloud; "let them have their way! They may render
      me unhappy; I will not complain. They sanctify my love by persecution.
      Happy, I should perhaps have been ashamed to love so much. But they rob me
      of air and liberty; I suffer; I weep. Ah! I feel proud that my heart still
      throbs with joy in the midst of so many evils. My sufferings will hallow
      my love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40c" id="Page_40c">[Pg 40]</a></span>
      will compel the respect of those who scoffed and slighted it. Herbert!
      dear Herbert! where are you at this moment? Do you joyfully anticipate
      to-morrow's dawn: are you busy with your boat, preparing it for its early
      cruise? Or do you sleep, dreaming of the old willows in the meadow,
      hearing the waters murmur through their branches, and the voice of
      Christine promising her return? But no; it cannot be; our hearts are too
      united for their feelings thus to differ! You are sad, my love, and you
      know not why; I am sad with knowledge of our misfortune&mdash;'tis the
      sole difference separation can establish between us. When shall we meet
      again, Herbert? Alas! I know not, but meet we surely shall. If God lets me
      live, he will let me love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine shut the window and threw herself on her bed without undressing.
      It was cold; she wrapped herself in her mantle, and gradually her head
      sank upon her breast. Her hands, at first pressed against each other,
      opened and fell by her sides. She dropped asleep, like an infant, in the
      midst of her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sun-rays, feeble though they were, awoke Christine, who sprang
      hastily from her couch. "Herbert waits for me!" she exclaimed. At her age
      memory is better for joy than for sorrow. For her the dawn of day was
      still a rendezvous of love. The next moment she awoke to<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41c" id="Page_41c">[Pg 41]</a></span> the
      consciousness of her captivity. She went to the window, leaned out as on
      the previous evening, and looked mournfully around. In a corner of the
      heavens was a glow of light, intercepted by billows of cloud. The pale
      foliage of the willows shivered in the breeze, which ruffled the leaves
      without bending the branches; the long fine grass of the meadow was seen
      through a veil of fog, as yet undispelled by the sun. The sounds of
      awakening nature had scarce begun, when a white sail stood out upon the
      surface of the stream, gliding lightly along like the open wing of a
      graceful bird. It passed to and fro in front of the meadow; was lowered
      before the trees, and then again displayed, bending the boat's gunwale to
      the water's surface, hovering continually around a point of the bank, as
      though confined within the circle of an invisible fascination. At long
      intervals the wind brought a faint and scarce perceptible sound, like the
      last notes of a song; then the little bark again man&oelig;uvred, and its
      sail flapped in the air. The pale tints of dawn gave way to the warmer
      sunbeams; passengers appeared upon the bank; trading boats ascended the
      river; the windows of the red brick house opened as if to inhale the
      morning air. The boat lowered its sail, and floated slowly away at the
      will of the current. Christine looked after it and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice during that day, Gothon opened the door<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_42c" id="Page_42c">[Pg 42]</a></span> of the young girl's
      chamber, and brought her a frugal meal. Twice did Gothon depart without
      uttering a word. The whole day passed in silence and solitude. Christine
      knew not how to get rid of the weary hours. She knelt before the crucifix,
      her alabaster rosary in her hand, her head raised towards the cross, and
      prayed. But her prayer was for Herbert, to see him again; she never
      dreamed of praying to forget him. Then she took down the guitar, passed
      round her neck the faded blue ribbon, tied on it at Seville, and which her
      mother would never allow to be changed. She struck a few chords of the
      songs she best loved; but her voice was choked, and her tears flowed more
      abundantly when she tried to sing. She collected the little sprays of
      willow, and placed them in a book to dry and preserve them. But the day
      was very long; and the poor child fluttered in her prison like a caged
      bird, with an anguish that each moment increased. Her head burned, her
      bosom throbbed. At last night came. Seated near the open window, the cold
      calmed her a little. They brought her no light, and time passed more
      slowly than ever. She went to bed, but, deprived of her accustomed
      exercise, tormented by a thousand anxieties, she could not sleep; she got
      up, walked about in the darkness, and again lay down; slumber still
      avoided her. This time her eyes, red with tears and watchfulness, beheld
      the sun rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43c" id="Page_43c">[Pg 43]</a></span>
      without illusion; she did not for a moment forget her captivity, but
      looked mournfully out at the little sail which, faithful to its
      rendezvous, came each morning with the sun. Again, none but Gothon
      disturbed her solitude. During another long day, Christine, alternately
      desponding and excited, walked, wept, lamented, and prayed. Night came
      again. Nothing broke the silence; the lights in the red house were
      extinguished one after the other. Profound darkness covered the earth.
      Christine remained at her window, insensible to cold. Suddenly she
      started: she heard her name pronounced in low tones at the foot of the
      wall. She listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine, my daughter!" repeated the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," exclaimed Christine, "you out in this dreadful weather! I
      conjure you to go in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been two days in bed, my child; I have been unwell; to-night I am
      better; I felt it impossible to remain longer without seeing you, who are
      my life, my strength, my health! Oh! you were right not to leave me; it
      would have killed me. Are you well, dear Christine? Have you all you
      require? How do you live, deprived of my caresses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest mother, for heaven's sake, go in! The night is damp and cold; it
      will be your death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your voice warms me; it is far from you that<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_44c" id="Page_44c">[Pg 44]</a></span> I feel chill and faint.
      Dearest child, my heart sends you a thousand kisses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I receive them on my knees, mother, my arms extended towards you. But,
      when shall I see you again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you submit, and promise to obey; when you no longer seek him you are
      forbidden to see, and whom you must forget. My daughter, it is your duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh mother, I thought your heart could better understand what it never
      felt. I thought you respected the true sentiments of the soul, and that
      your lips knew not how to utter the word 'forget.' If I forgot, I should
      be a mere silly child, capricious, unruly, unworthy your tenderness. If my
      malady is without remedy, I am a steadfast woman, suffering and
      self-sacrificing. Good God! how is it you do not understand that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," murmured Annunciata, but in so low a tone that she was
      sure her daughter could not hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," resumed Christine, "go to my father! summon up that courage
      which fails you when you alone are concerned; speak boldly to him, tell
      him what I have told you; demand my liberty, my happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!" exclaimed Annunciata in terror; "I brave M. Van Amberg, and oppose
      his will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not oppose, but supplicate! compel his heart<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_45c" id="Page_45c">[Pg 45]</a></span> to understand what mine
      experiences; force him to see and hear and feel that my life may cease,
      but not my love. Who can do it, if you cannot? I am a captive. My sisters
      know not love, my uncle William has never known it. It needs a woman's
      voice to express a woman's feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine, you know not what you ask. The effort is above my strength."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ask a proof of my mother's love; I am sure she will give it me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall die in so doing. M. Van Amberg can kill me by a word."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine started and trembled. "Do not go, then, dearest mother. Forgive
      my egotism; I thought only of myself. If my father has such terrible
      power, avoid his anger. I will wait, and entreat none but God."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief pause. "Christine," said Madame Van Amberg, "since I am
      your only hope, your sole reliance, and you have called me to your aid, I
      will speak to him. Our fate is in the hands of heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      Annunciata interrupted herself by a cry of terror; a hand rudely grasped
      her arm; M. Van Amberg, without uttering a word, dragged her to the house
      door, compelled her to enter, took out the key, and made her pass before
      him into the parlour. A lamp burned dimly upon the table, its oil nearly
      exhausted; at times it emitted a bright flash, and<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_46c" id="Page_46c">[Pg 46]</a></span> then suddenly became
      nearly extinguished. The corners of the room were in darkness, the doors
      and windows closed, perfect silence reigned; the only object on which a
      strong light fell, was the countenance of M. Van Amberg. It was calm,
      cold, motionless. His great height, the piercing look of his pale grey
      eyes, the austere regularity of his features, combined to give him the
      aspect of an implacable judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would speak with me, madam," said he to Annunciata; "I am here,
      speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the parlour, Annunciata let herself fall into a chair. Her
      clothes streamed with water; her hair, heavy with rain, fell upon her
      shoulders; her extreme paleness gave her the appearance of a corpse rather
      than of a living creature. Terror obliterated memory, even of what had
      just occurred; her mind was confused; she felt only that she suffered
      horribly. Her husband's voice and words restored the chain of her ideas;
      the poor woman thought of her child, made a violent effort, rallied her
      strength, and rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then," she murmured, "since it must be so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg waited in silence, his arms crossed upon his breast, his
      eyes fixed upon his wife; he stood like a statue, assisting neither by
      word nor gesture the poor creature who trembled before him. Annunciata
      looked long at him before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47c"
      id="Page_47c">[Pg 47]</a></span> speaking; she hoped that at sight of her
      tears and sufferings, M. Van Amberg would remember he had loved her. She
      threw her whole soul into her eyes, but not a muscle of her husband's
      countenance moved. He waited for her to break silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I need your indulgence," she at last said; "it costs me a fearful effort
      to address you. In general I do but answer; I am unaccustomed to speak
      first, and I am afraid. I dread your anger; have compassion on a trembling
      woman, who would fain be silent, and who must speak. Christine's happiness
      is in your hands. The poor child implores me to soften your rigour.... Did
      I refuse, not a creature upon earth would intercede for her. This is why I
      venture to petition you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg continued silent. Annunciata wiped the tears from her cheeks
      and resumed with more courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is much to be pitied; she has inherited the faults you blame in me.
      Believe me, sir, I have laboured hard to check them in the bud. I have
      striven, exhorted, punished, have spared neither advice nor prayers, but
      all in vain. God has not been pleased to spare me this new grief. Her
      nature is unchangeable; she is to blame, but she is also much to be
      pitied. Christine loves with all her soul. Women die of such love as hers,
      and when they do not die, they suffer frightfully. For pity's sake, sir,
      let her marry him she loves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48c" id="Page_48c">[Pg 48]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Annunciata covered her face with her hands, and awaited in an agony of
      anxiety her husband's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your daughter," said M. Van Amberg, "is still a child; she has inherited,
      as you say, a character that needs restraint. I will not yield to the
      first caprice that traverses her silly head. Herbert is only
      two-and-twenty; we know nothing of his character. Your daughter requires a
      protector, and a judicious guide. Herbert has neither family, fortune, nor
      position. He shall never be the husband of a woman who bears the name of
      Mademoiselle Van Amberg!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!" cried Annunciata, clasping her hands and breathless with emotion,
      "Sir! the best guidance for a woman's life is a union with the man she
      loves! It is her best safeguard, it strengthens her against the cares of
      the world. I entreat you, Karl!" exclaimed Madame Van Amberg, falling upon
      her knees, "have compassion on my daughter! Do not render duty a torture;
      do not exact from her too much courage! We are weak creatures: we have
      need both of love and virtue. Place her not in the terrible necessity of
      choosing between them. Pity, Karl, pity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," cried M. Van Amberg, and this time his frame was agitated by a
      slight nervous trembling, "Madam, you are very bold to speak to me thus!
      You! you! to dare to hold such language<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_49c" id="Page_49c">[Pg 49]</a></span> to me! Silence! and teach
      your daughter not to hesitate in her choice between good and evil. Do
      that, instead of weeping uselessly at my feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is bold of me, sir, thus to address you; but I have found courage
      in suffering. I am ill,&mdash;in pain,&mdash;my life is worthless, save as
      a sacrifice&mdash;let my child take it, I will speak for her! Her fate is
      in your hands, do not crush her by a cruel decision! An absolute judge and
      master should be guarded in word and deed, for a reckoning will be asked
      of him! Be merciful to my child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg approached his wife, took her arm, placed his other hand on
      her mouth, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence! I command you; no such scenes in my house, no noise and
      whimpering. Your daughters sleep within a few yards of you, do not disturb
      their repose. Your servants are above, do not awaken them. Silence! you
      had no business to speak; I was wrong to listen to you. Never dare again
      to discuss my orders; it is I whom your children must obey, I whom you
      must obey yourself. Retire to your apartment, and to-morrow let me find
      you what you yesterday were."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg had regained his usual calmness. He walked slowly from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my daughter!" exclaimed Annunciata, despairingly, "nothing can I do
      for you! Merciful Father! what will become of me, placed between him and
      her, both inflexible in their resolves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50c" id="Page_50c">[Pg 50]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp which feebly illuminated this scene of sorrow, now suddenly went
      out and left the unhappy mother in profound darkness. The rain beat
      against the windows,&mdash;the wind howled,&mdash;the house clock struck
      four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine had seen M. Van Amberg seize Annunciata's arm, and lead her away
      with him; afterwards, she had distinguished, through the slight partitions
      of the house, a faint echo as of mingled sobs, entreaties, and reproaches.
      She understood that her fate was deciding,&mdash;that her poor mother had
      devoted herself for her, and was face to face with the stern ruler whose
      look alone she usually dared not brave. Christine passed the night in
      terrible anxiety, abandoning herself alternately to discouragement and to
      joyful hopes. At her age it is not easy to despair. Fear, however,
      predominated over every other emotion, and she would have given years of
      existence to learn what had passed. But the day went by like the previous
      one. She saw none but Gothon. Her she ventured to question, but the old
      servant had orders not to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day elapsed. Christine's solitude was still unbroken, no friendly
      voice reached her ear, no kindly hand lifted the veil shrouding her
      future. The poor girl was exhausted, she had not even the energy of grief.
      She wept without complaint, almost without a murmur. Night came, and she
      fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51c" id="Page_51c">[Pg 51]</a></span>
      asleep, exhausted by her sorrow. She had scarcely slept an hour when she
      was awakened by the opening of the door, and Gothon, lamp in hand,
      approached her bed. "Get up Mademoiselle," said the servant, "and follow
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christine dressed herself as in a dream, and hastily followed Gothon, who
      conducted her to her mother's room, opened the door, and drew back to let
      her pass. A sad spectacle met the young girl's eyes. Annunciata, pale and
      almost inanimate, lay in the agonies of death. Her presentiment had not
      deceived her; suffering and agitation had snapped the slender strings that
      bound her to the earth. The light of the lamp fell full upon her features,
      whose gentle beauty pain was impotent to deface. Resignation and courage
      were upon her countenance, over which came a gleam of joy when Christine
      appeared. Wilhelmina and Maria knelt and wept at the foot of their
      mother's bed. William stood a little apart, holding a prayer-book, but his
      eyes had left the page to look at Annunciata, and two large tears trembled
      on their lids. M. Van Amberg, seated beside his wife's pillow, had his
      face shaded by his hand, so that none could see its expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a piercing cry, Christine rushed to Madame Van Amberg, who received
      her in her arms. "Mother!" she cried, her cheek against Annunciata's, "it
      is I who have killed you! For love of me you have exceeded your strength."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52c" id="Page_52c">[Pg 52]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my beloved, no," replied Annunciata, kissing her daughter between
      each word, "I die of an old and incurable malady. But I die happy, since I
      once more clasp you in my arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they did not let me nurse you!" cried Christine, indignantly raising
      her head; "they concealed your illness! They let me weep for other sorrows
      than yours, my mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest child," replied Annunciata gently, "this crisis has been very
      sudden; two hours ago they knew not my danger, and I wished to fulfil my
      religious duties before seeing you. I wished to think only of God. Now I
      can abandon myself to the embraces of my children." And she clasped her
      weeping daughters to her heart. "Dear children," said she, "God is full of
      mercy to the dying, and sanctifies a mother's benediction. I bless you, my
      daughters; remember and pray for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three young girls bowed their heads upon their mother's hand, and
      replied by tears alone to this solemn farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good brother," resumed Annunciata to William, "my good brother, we
      have long lived together, and to me you have ever been a devoted friend,
      indulgent and gentle. I thank you, brother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      William averted his head to conceal his tears, but a deep sob escaped him,
      and he turned his venerable face towards Annunciata.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53c" id="Page_53c">[Pg 53]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not thank me, sister," he said, "I have done little for you. I loved
      you, that is certain, but I could not enliven your solitude. My sister,
      you will still live for the happiness of us all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Annunciata gently shook her head. Her glance sought her husband, as if she
      would fain have addressed her last words to him. But they expired on her
      lips. She looked at him timidly, sadly, and then closed her eyes, to check
      the starting tears. She grew visibly weaker, and as death approached, a
      painful anxiety took possession of her. Resigned, she was not calm. It was
      ordained her soul should suffer and be troubled to the end. The destiny of
      one of her daughters disturbed her last moments; she dared not pronounce
      the name of Christine, she dared not ask compassion for her; a thousand
      conflicting doubts and fears agitated her poor heart. She died as she had
      lived, repressing her tears, concealing her thoughts. From time to time
      she turned to her husband, but his head continued sunk upon his hand; not
      one look of encouragement could she obtain. At last came the spasm that
      was to break this frail existence. "Adieu! Adieu!" she murmured in
      unintelligible accents. Her eyes no longer obeyed her, and none could tell
      whom they sought. William approached his brother, and placed his hand upon
      his shoulder. "Karl!" he whispered in tones audible but to him he
      addressed, "she is dying! Have you nothing to say to a poor<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54c" id="Page_54c">[Pg 54]</a></span>
      creature who has so long lived with you and suffered by you? Living, you
      loved her not; do not let her die thus! Fear you not, Karl, lest this
      woman, oppressed and slighted by you, should expire with a leaven of
      resentment in her heart? Crave her pardon before she departs."
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant all was silent. M. Van Amberg stirred not. Annunciata, her
      head thrown back, seemed to have already ceased to exist. On a sudden, she
      moved, raised herself with difficulty, leaned over towards M. Van Amberg,
      and groped for his hand as though she had been blind. When she found it,
      she bowed her face upon it, kissed it twice, and expired in that last
      kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On your knees!" cried William, "on your knees, she is in heaven! let us
      implore her intercession!" And all knelt down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the prayers addressed to God by man during his life of trial, not
      one is more solemn than that which escapes the desolate heart, when a
      beloved soul flies from earth to heaven, to stand, for the first time, in
      the presence of its Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Van Amberg rose from his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave the room!" said he to his brother and daughters, "I would be alone
      with my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone, beside the bed of his dead wife, Karl Van Amberg gazed upon the
      pale countenance, to which death had restored all the beauty of youth. A
      tear, left there by human suffering, a tear which none<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_55c" id="Page_55c">[Pg 55]</a></span> other was to follow,
      glittered upon the clay-cold cheek; one arm still hung out of bed, as when
      it held his hand; the head was in the position in which it had kissed his
      fingers. He gazed at her, and the icy envelope that bound his heart was at
      last broken. "Annunciata!" he exclaimed, "Annunciata!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For fifteen years that name had not passed his lips. Throwing himself on
      his wife's corpse, he clasped her in his arms and kissed her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Annunciata!" he cried, "can you not feel this kiss of peace and love!
      Annunciata, we have both suffered terribly! God did not grant us
      happiness. I loved you from the first day that I saw you, a joyous child
      in Spain, till this sad moment that I press you dead upon my heart. Oh
      Annunciata, how great have been our sufferings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Karl Van Amberg wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Repose in peace, poor woman!" he murmured; "may you find in heaven the
      repose denied you upon earth!" And with trembling hand he closed
      Annunciata's eyes. Then he knelt down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almighty God!" he said, "I have been severe. Be thou merciful!"
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      When, at break of day, M. Van Amberg left the chamber of death, his face
      had resumed its habitual expression; his inflexible soul, for a moment
      bowed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56c" id="Page_56c">[Pg 56]</a></span>
      had regained its usual level. To Annunciata had been given the last word
      of love, the last tear of that heart of adamant. To the eyes of all he
      reappeared as the stern master and father, the man on whose brow no sorrow
      left a trace. His daughters bowed themselves upon his passage, William
      spoke not to him, order and regularity returned to the house. Annunciata
      was buried without pomp or procession. She left, to revisit it no more,
      the melancholy abode where her suffering soul had worn out its mortal
      envelope; she ceased to live, as a sound ceases to be heard, as a cloud
      passes, as a flower fades; nothing stopped or altered because she went. If
      any mourned her, they mourned in silence; if they thought of her, they
      proclaimed not their thoughts; her name was no more heard; only the
      interior of the little red house was rather more silent, and M. Van
      Amberg's countenance appeared to all more rigid than before. During the
      day, Christine's profound grief obeyed the iron will that weighed on each
      member of the family. The poor child was silent, worked, sat at table,
      lived on as if her heart had not been crushed; but at night, alone in the
      little room where her mother had so often wept with her, she gave free
      course to grief; she invoked her mother, spoke to her, extended her arms
      to her, and would fain have left the earth to be with her in heaven. "Take
      me to you, dear mother!" she would exclaim. "Deprived of you,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57c" id="Page_57c">[Pg 57]</a></span> apart
      from him, I cannot live! Since I saw you die, I no longer fear death."
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the death of Annunciata, Christine was allowed her liberty, M. Van
      Amberg doubtless thinking, and with reason, that she would make no use of
      it during her first grief. Or, perhaps, with his wife's corpse scarcely
      cold, he hesitated to recur to the severity that had caused her so many
      tears. Whatever his motive, Christine was free, at least to all
      appearance. The three sisters, in deep mourning, never passed the
      threshold; they sat all day at work near the low window of the parlour,
      supped with their uncle and father, then retired to bed. During the long
      hours of their silent work, Christine often thought of her lover. She
      dared not attempt to see him; she would have expected to hear her mother's
      voice murmur in her ear,&mdash;"My daughter, it is too soon to be happy!
      Mourn me yet a little, alone and without consolation."
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, after a night of tears, Christine fell into a tardy slumber,
      broken by dreams. Now it was her mother, who took her in her arms, and
      flew with her towards heaven. "I will not let you live," said Annunciata,
      "for life is sorrow. I have prayed of God to let you die young, that you
      may not weep as I have wept!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant she beheld herself clothed in white and crowned with
      flowers. Herbert was there, love sparkling in his eyes. "Come, my<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58c" id="Page_58c">[Pg 58]</a></span>
      betrothed!" he said, "life is joy! My love shall guard you from all evil;
      come, we will be happy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She started up, awakened by a sudden noise in her chamber. The window was
      open, and on the floor lay a pebble with a letter attached. Her first
      impulse was to fly to the window; a bush stirred in the direction of the
      river, but she saw no one. She snatched up the letter, she guessed it was
      Herbert's writing. It seems as if one never saw for the first time the
      writing of him one loves; the heart recognises as if the eyes had already
      seen it. Christine was alone, a beam of the rising sun tinted the summits
      of the willows, and hope and love revived in the young girl's heart, as
      she read what follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine, I can write but a few lines; a long letter, difficult to
      conceal, might never reach you. Hear me with your heart, and guess what I
      am unable to write. As you know, dearest, my family intrusted me to your
      father, and gave him all authority over me. He can employ me at his will,
      and according to the convenience of his commercial establishments.
      Christine, I have just received orders to embark in one of his ships,
      sailing for Batavia."
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry escaped Christine's lips, and her eyes, suffused with tears,
      devoured the subsequent lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father places the immensity of ocean between<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_59c" id="Page_59c">[Pg 59]</a></span> us; he separates us for
      ever. We are to meet no more! Christine, has your heart, since I last saw
      you, learned to comprehend those words? No, my adored Christine, we must
      live or die together! Your poor mother is no more; your presence is no
      longer essential to the happiness of any one. Your family is pitiless and
      without affection for you. Your future is gloom and unhappiness. Come,
      then, let us fly together. In the Helder are numerous ships; they will
      bear us far from the scene of our sufferings. All is foreseen and
      arranged. Christine, my life depends on your decision. For ever separated!
      ... subscribe to that barbarous decree, and I terminate an existence which
      henceforward would be all bitterness! And you, Christine! will you love
      another, or live without love? Oh! come! I have suffered so much without
      you! I summon you, I await you, Christine! my bride! At midnight&mdash;on
      the riverbank&mdash;I will be there! and a world of happiness is before
      us. Come, dear Christine, come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As Christine read, her tears fell fast on Herbert's letter. She
      experienced a moment of agonising indecision. She loved passionately, but
      she was young and innocent, and love had not yet imparted to her pure soul
      the audacity that braves all things. The wise counsels heard in her
      father's house, uncle William's pious exhortations, the holy prayers she
      had learned from her infancy upwards,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_60c" id="Page_60c">[Pg 60]</a></span> resounded in her ears;
      the Christ upon her wooden crucifix seemed to look at her; the beads of
      her rosary were still warm with the pressure of her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! my dream! my dream!" she exclaimed; "Herbert who calls his bride! my
      mother claiming her daughter! With him, life and love! With her, death and
      heaven!..." And Christine sobbed aloud. For an instant she tried calmly to
      contemplate an existence in that melancholy house, weeping for Herbert,
      growing old without him, without love, within those gloomy walls, where no
      heart sympathised with hers. The picture was too terrible; she felt that
      such a future was unendurable. She wept bitterly, kissed her rosary, her
      prayer-book, as if bidding adieu to all that had witnessed the innocence
      of her early years. Then her heart beat violently. The fire of her glance
      dried her tears. She looked out at the river, at the white sail which
      seemed to remind her of her vows of love; she gave one last sob, as if
      breaking irrevocably the links between her past and future. The image of
      her mother was no longer before her. Christine, abandoned to herself,
      followed the impulse of her passionate nature; she wept, trembled,
      hesitated, and at last exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "At midnight, I will be there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she wiped her tears, and remained quite still for a few moments, to
      calm her violent agitation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61c"
      id="Page_61c">[Pg 61]</a></span> A vast future unrolled itself before her;
      liberty would be hers; a new world was revealed to her eyes; a new life
      began for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last night came. A lamp replaced the fading daylight. The window was
      deserted for the table. William and Karl Van Amberg came in. The former
      took a book; his brother busied himself with commercial calculations. The
      lamp gave a dull light; all was silent, sad, and monotonous in the
      apartment. The clock slowly told the successive hours. When its hammer
      struck ten, there was a movement round the table; books were shut, work
      was folded. Karl Van Amberg rose; his two eldest daughters approached him,
      and he kissed their foreheads in silence. Christine no longer a captive,
      but still in disgrace, bowed herself before her father. Uncle William,
      grown drowsy over his book, put up his spectacles, muttering a
      "good-night." The family left the parlour, and the three sisters ascended
      the wooden staircase. At her chamber door, Christine felt a tightness at
      her heart. She turned and looked after her sisters. "Good-night,
      Wilhelmina! good-night, Maria!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters turned their heads. By the faint light of their tapers
      Christine saw them smile and kiss their hands to her. Then they entered
      their rooms without speaking. Christine found herself alone. She opened
      her window; the night was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62c"
      id="Page_62c">[Pg 62]</a></span> calm; at intervals clouds flitted across
      the moon, veiling its brightness. Christine made no preparations for
      departure; she only took her mother's rosary, and the blue ribbon so long
      attached to the guitar; then she wrapped herself in her black mantle and
      sat down by the window. Her heart beat quick, but no distinct thought
      agitated her mind. She trembled without terror; her eyes were tearful, but
      she felt no regret. For her, the hour was rather solemn than sad; the
      struggle was over, and she was irrevocably decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last midnight came; each stroke of the clock thrilled Christine's
      heart; for an instant she stood still, summoning strength and courage;
      then, turning towards the interior of the room,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, my mother!" she whispered. Many living creatures dwelt under that
      roof. It seemed to Christine as if she left her only who was no longer
      there. "Adieu, my mother!" she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she stepped out of the window; a trellis, twined with creepers,
      covered the wall. With light foot and steady hand, Christine descended,
      aiding herself by the branches, and pausing when they cracked under her
      tread or grasp. The stillness was so complete that the slightest sound
      assumed importance. Christine's heart beat violently; at last she reached
      the ground, raised her head, and looked at the house. Her father's window
      was still lighted. Again she shuddered with<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_63c" id="Page_63c">[Pg 63]</a></span> apprehension; then,
      feeling more courage for a minute's daring than for half an hour's
      precautions, she darted across the meadow and arrived breathless at the
      clump of willows. Before plunging into it, she again looked round. All was
      quiet and deserted; she breathed more freely and disappeared amongst the
      branches. Leaning upon the old tree, the witness of her former rendezvous,
      she whispered, so softly that none but a lover could hear, "Herbert, are
      you there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A cautious oar skimmed the water; a well-known voice replied. The boat
      approached the willow; the young student stood up and held out his arms to
      Christine, who leaped lightly into the skiff. In an instant, they were out
      of the willow-shaded inlet; in another, the sail&mdash;the signal of their
      loves&mdash;was hoisted to the breeze; the bark sped swiftly over the
      water, and Herbert, scarce daring to believe his happiness, was seated at
      Christine's feet. His hand sought hers; he heard her weep, and he wept for
      sympathy. Both were silent, agitated, uneasy, and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the night was fine, the moon shed its softest light, the ripple of the
      stream had a harmony of its own, the light breeze cooled their cheeks, the
      sail bent over them like the wing of an invisible being; they were young,
      they loved, it was impossible that joy should not revive in their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Christine, thanks!" exclaimed Herbert,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_64c" id="Page_64c">[Pg 64]</a></span> "thanks a thousand times
      for so much devotedness, for such confidence and love! Oh how beautiful
      will life now appear! We are united for ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For ever!" repeated Christine, her tears flowing afresh. For the first
      time she felt that great happiness, like great grief, expresses itself by
      tears. Her hand in Herbert's, her eyes raised to heaven, she gazed upon
      bright stars and fleecy clouds, sole and silent witnesses of her
      happiness. Presently she was roused from this sweet reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See there, Herbert!" she exclaimed; "the sail droops along the mast, the
      wind has fallen, we do not advance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert took the oars, and the boat cut rapidly through the water. Wrapped
      in her mantle, Christine sat opposite, and smiled upon him. Onwards flew
      the boat, a track of foam in its wake. Daylight was still distant; all
      things favoured the fugitives. Again Christine broke silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert, dear Herbert, do you hear nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert ceased to row, and listened. "I hear nothing," he said, "save the
      plash of the river against its banks." He resumed the oars; again the boat
      moved rapidly forward. Christine was pale; half risen from her seat, her
      head turned back, she strove to see, but the darkness was too great.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be tranquil, best beloved," said Herbert with a smile. "Fear creates
      sounds. All is still."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65c" id="Page_65c">[Pg 65]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert," cried Christine, this time starting up in the boat, "I am not
      mistaken! I hear oars behind us ... pause not to listen ... row, for
      Heaven's love, row!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her terror was so great, she seemed so sure of what she said, that Herbert
      obeyed in silence, and a sensation of alarm chilled his heart. Christine
      seated herself at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are pursued!" she said; "the noise of your own oars alone prevented
      your hearing. A boat follows us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be so," Herbert cried, "what matter! That boat does not bear
      Christine&mdash;is not guided by a man who defends his life, his
      happiness, his love. My arm will weary his, his bark will not overtake
      mine." And Herbert redoubled his efforts. The veins of his arms swelled to
      bursting; his forehead was covered with sweat-drops. The skiff clove the
      waters as though impelled by wings. Christine remained crouched at the
      young man's feet, pressing herself against him, as to seek refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other oars, wielded by stalwart arms, now struck the water not far from
      Herbert's boat. The young student heard the sound; he bent over his oars
      and made desperate efforts. But he felt his strength failing; as he rowed
      he looked with agony at Christine; no one spoke, only the noise of the two
      boats interrupted the silence. Around, all was calm and serene as when the
      fugitives set out. But the soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66c"
      id="Page_66c">[Pg 66]</a></span> of the young girl had passed from life to
      death; her eyes, gleaming with a wild fire, followed with increasing
      terror each movement of Herbert's; she saw by the suffering expression of
      his countenance, that little hope of escape remained. Still he rowed with
      the energy of despair; but the fatal bark drew nearer, its shadow was seen
      upon the water, it followed hard in the foamy track of Herbert's boat.
      Christine stood up and looked back; just then the moon shone out, casting
      its light full upon the pale, passionless features of M. Van Amberg.
      Christine uttered a piercing cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father!" she cried; "Herbert, 'tis my father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert also had recognised his pursuer. The youth had lived too long in
      Karl Van Amberg's house not to have experienced the strange kind of
      fascination which that man exercised over all around him. Darkness had
      passed away to reveal to the fugitives the father, master, and judge!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, Herbert!" cried Christine, "we are lost, escape is impossible! Do
      you not see my father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me row!" replied Herbert, disengaging himself from Christine, who had
      seized his arm. He gave so violent a pull with the oars, that the skiff
      bounded out of the water and seemed to gain a little on its pursuer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert," cried Christine, "I tell you we are lost! 'Tis my father, and
      resistance is useless!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67c"
      id="Page_67c">[Pg 67]</a></span> God will not work a miracle in our
      favour! Herbert, I will not return to my father's house! Let us die
      together, dear Herbert!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Christine threw herself into her lover's arms. The oars fell from the
      young man's hands; with a cry of anguish he pressed Christine convulsively
      to his heart. For a single instant he thought of obeying her, and of
      plunging with her into the dark tide beneath; but Herbert had a noble
      heart, and he repelled the temptation of despair. The next moment a
      violent shock made the boat quiver, and M. Van Amberg stepped into it.
      Instinctively Herbert clasped Christine more tightly, and retreated, as if
      his strength could withhold her from her father&mdash;as if, in that
      little boat, he could retreat far enough not to be overtaken. With a
      vigorous arm, M. Van Amberg seized Christine, whose slender form bent like
      a reed over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have mercy on her!" cried the despairing Herbert; "I alone am guilty!
      Punish her not, and I promise to depart, to renounce her! Pity, sir! pity
      for Christine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to a deaf and silent statue. Wresting Christine's hand from the
      student's grasp, M. Van Amberg stepped back into his boat, and pushed
      Herbert's violently with his foot. Yielding to the impulse, the boats
      separated; one was pulled swiftly up the river, whilst the other,
      abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68c" id="Page_68c">[Pg 68]</a></span>
      to itself, was swept by the current in a contrary direction. Erect on the
      prow of his bark, his head thrown back, his arms folded on his breast, M.
      Van Amberg fixed a terrible look upon Herbert and then disappeared in the
      darkness. All was over. The father had taken his daughter, and no human
      power could henceforward tear her from his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a week from that fatal night, the gates of a convent closed upon
      Christine Van Amberg.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      On the frontier of Belgium, on the summit of a hill, stands a large white
      building of irregular architecture, a confused mass of walls, roofs,
      angles, and platforms. At the foot of the hill is a village, whose
      inhabitants behold with a feeling of respect the edifice towering above
      their humble dwellings. For there is seen the belfry of a church, and
      thence is heard unceasingly the sound of pious bells, proclaiming afar
      that on the mountain's summit a few devout souls pray to God for all men.
      The building is a convent; the poor and the sick well know the path
      leading to the hospitable threshold of the Sisters of the Visitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this convent was Christine sent. To this austere dwelling, the abode of
      silence and self-denial, was she, the young, the beautiful, the loving,
      pitilessly consigned. It was as though a gravestone had suddenly closed
      over her head. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69c" id="Page_69c">[Pg
      69]</a></span> her, the superior of the convent received the following
      letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="blockquot">
      "<span class="smcap">Madame la Supérieure</span>,&mdash;I send you your
      niece, Christine Van Amberg, and beg you to oblige me by keeping her with
      you. I intend her to embrace a religious life; employ the influence of
      your wise counsels to predispose her to it. Her misconduct compels me to
      exclude her my house; she requires restraint and watching, such as are
      only to be found in a convent. Be pleased, dear and respected kinswoman,
      to receive her under your roof; the best wish that can be formed for her
      is, that she may make up her mind to remain there for ever. Should she
      inquire concerning a young man named Herbert, you may inform her that he
      has sailed to Batavia, whence he will proceed to our most remote
      settlements.
    </p>
    <p class="blockquot">
      "I am, with respect, <i>Madame la Supérieure</i>, your kinsman and friend,
    </p>
    <p class="blockquot right">
      "<span class="smcap">Karl Van Amberg.</span>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years had elapsed since the date of this letter, when one day the
      convent gate opened to admit a stranger, who craved to speak with the
      superior. The stranger was an old man; a staff sustained his feeble steps.
      Whilst waiting in the parlour, he looked about him with surprise and<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70c" id="Page_70c">[Pg 70]</a></span>
      emotion, and several times he passed his hand across his eyes as if to
      brush away a tear. "Poor, poor child!" he muttered. When the superior
      appeared behind the grating, he advanced quickly towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am William Van Amberg," he said, "the brother of Karl Van Amberg. I
      come, madam, to fetch Christine, his daughter and my niece."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You come very late!" replied the superior; "sister Martha-Mary is on the
      eve of pronouncing her vows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Martha-Mary!&mdash;I do not know the name!" said William Van Amberg; "I
      seek Christine&mdash;my niece Christine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine Van Amberg, now sister Martha-Mary, is about to take the veil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine a nun! Oh, impossible! Madame, they have broken the child's
      heart; from despair only would she take the veil; they have been cruel&mdash;they
      have tortured her; but I bring her liberty and the certainty of happiness,&mdash;permission
      to marry him she loves. Let me speak to her and she will quickly follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak to her then; and let her depart if such be her will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, madam,&mdash;a thousand thanks! Send me my child, send me my
      Christine&mdash;with joy and impatience I await her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The superior retired. Left alone, William again<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_71c" id="Page_71c">[Pg 71]</a></span> contemplated the
      melancholy abode in which he found himself, and the more he gazed, the
      sadder his heart became. He would fain have taken Christine in his arms,
      as he did when she was little, and have fled with her from those chilly
      walls and dismal gratings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child!" he repeated, "what a retreat for the bright years of your
      youth!... How you must have suffered! But console thyself, dearest child,
      I am here to rescue thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered Christine as a wild young girl, delighting in liberty, air,
      and motion; then as an impassioned woman, full of love and independence.
      And a smile crossed the old man's lips as he thought of her burst of joy,
      when he should say to her,&mdash;"You are free, and Herbert waits to lead
      you to the altar!" His heart beat as it had never beaten in the best days
      of his youth; he counted the minutes and kept his eyes fixed upon the
      little door through which Christine was to come. He could not fold her in
      his arms, the grating prevented it, but at least he should see and hear
      her. Suddenly all his blood rushed to his heart, for the hinges creaked
      and the door opened. A novice, clothed in white, slowly advanced; he
      looked at her, started back, hesitated, and exclaimed: "Oh God! is that
      Christine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      William had cherished in his heart the memory of a bright-eyed, sunburnt
      girl, alert and lively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72c"
      id="Page_72c">[Pg 72]</a></span> quick and decided in her movements,
      running more often than she walked, like the graceful roe that loves the
      mountain-steeps. He beheld a tall young woman, white and colourless as the
      robes that shrouded her; her hair concealed under a thick linen band, her
      slender form scarcely to be distinguished beneath the heavy folds of her
      woollen vestments. Her movements were slow, her black eyes veiled by an
      indescribable languor; a profound calm was the characteristic of her whole
      being&mdash;a calm so great, that it resembled absence of life. One might
      have thought her eyes looked without seeing, that her lips could not open
      to speak, that her ears listened without hearing. Sister Martha-Mary was
      beautiful, but her beauty was not of the earth&mdash;it was the beauty of
      infinite repose,&mdash;of a calm that nothing could disturb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man was touched to the bottom of his soul; the words expired on
      his lips, and he extended his hands towards Christine. On beholding her
      uncle, Martha-Mary endeavoured to smile, but moved not, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh my child!" cried William at last, "how you must suffer here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha-Mary gently shook her head, and the tranquil look she fixed upon
      her uncle, protested against his supposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible that five years have thus changed my Christine! My heart
      recognises you, my child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73c"
      id="Page_73c">[Pg 73]</a></span> not my eyes! They have compelled you to
      great austerities, severe privations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cruel bondage has weighed heavily upon you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been ill then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your poor heart has suffered too much, and has broken. You have shed many
      tears?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember them no longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine! Christine! do you live? or has the shade of Annunciata risen
      from the grave? Oh my child! in seeing you, I seem to see her corpse,
      extended on the bed of death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha-Mary raised her large eyes to heaven; she joined her hands, and
      murmured, "My mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine, speak to me! weep with me! you frighten me by your calm and
      silence.... Ah! in my trouble and emotion, I have as yet explained
      nothing.... Listen: my brother Karl, by the failure of a partner, suddenly
      found his whole fortune compromised. To avoid total ruin he was obliged to
      embark immediately for the colonies. He set sail expecting to return in a
      few years; but his affairs prolong his absence, and his return is
      indefinitely postponed. His two eldest daughters are with him. To me, who
      am too old to follow him, too old to remain alone, he has given Christine.
      I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74c" id="Page_74c">[Pg 74]</a></span>
      would not accept the precious charge, my child, without the possibility of
      rendering you happy. I implored permission to marry you to Herbert. You
      are no longer a rich heiress: your father gone, you need protection, and
      that of an old man cannot long avail you. In short, your father has agreed
      to all I asked: he sends you, as a farewell gift, your liberty and his
      consent to your marriage.... Christine! you are free, and Herbert awaits
      his bride!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The long drapery of the novice was slightly agitated, as if the limbs it
      covered trembled; she remained some seconds without speaking, and then
      replied, "It is too late! I am the affianced of the Lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      William uttered a cry of grief, and looked with alarm at the pale calm
      girl, who stood immovable before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine!" he cried, "you no longer love Herbert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the affianced of the Lord!" repeated the novice, her hands crossed
      upon her breast, her eyes raised to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh my God! my God!" cried William, weeping bitterly, "my brother has
      killed his child! Her soul has been sad even unto death! Poor victim of
      severity, tell me, Christine, tell me, what has passed within you, during
      your abode here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw others pray, and I prayed also. There<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_75c" id="Page_75c">[Pg 75]</a></span> was a great stillness,
      and I was silent; none wept, and I dried my tears; a something, at first
      cold, then soothing, enveloped my soul. The voice of God made itself heard
      to me, and I listened; I loved the Lord, and gave myself to Him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if fatigued with speaking so much, Martha-Mary relapsed into
      silence, and into that absorbing meditation which rendered her insensible
      to surrounding things. Just then a bell tolled. The novice started, and
      her eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God calls me!" she said; "I go to pray!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine! my daughter, will you leave me thus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear you not the bell? It is the hour of prayer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Christine, dearest child, I came to take you hence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never leave these walls!" said Martha-Mary, gliding slowly away.
      As she opened the parlour door, she turned towards William; her eyes fixed
      upon him with a sad and sweet expression; her lips moved, as if to send
      him a kiss; then she disappeared. William made no attempt to detain her;
      his head was pressed against the grating, and big tears chased each other
      down his cheeks. How long he remained thus plunged in mournful reflection,
      he noted not. He was roused by the voice of the superior, who seated
      herself, wrapped in her black robes, on the other side of the grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76c" id="Page_76c">[Pg 76]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I foresaw your grief," she said. "Our sister Martha-Mary refuses to
      follow you."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a despairing look, William answered the nun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! alas!" he said, "the child I so dearly loved met me without joy,
      and left me without regret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, my son," resumed the superior; "listen to me.&mdash;Five years
      ago, there came to this convent a young girl overwhelmed with grief and
      sunk in terrible despair; her entrance here was to her a descent into the
      tomb. During one entire year, none saw her but with tears on her face.
      Only God knows how many tears the eyes must shed before a broken spirit
      regains calm and resignation; man cannot count them. This young girl
      suffered much; in vain we implored pardon for her, in vain we summoned her
      family to her relief. She might say, as is written in the psalm,&mdash;'<i>I
      am weary with my groaning: mine eye is consumed because of grief.</i>'
      What could we do, save pray for her, since none would receive her
      back!..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" cried William, "your letters never reached us. My brother was
      beyond sea; and I, having then no hope of changing his determination,&mdash;I
      had quitted his empty and melancholy house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man abandoned her," continued the superior, "but God looked upon His
      servant, and comforted her soul. If He does not see fit to restore
      strength to her body, exhausted by suffering&mdash;His will be<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77c" id="Page_77c">[Pg 77]</a></span> done!
      Perhaps it would now be wise and generous to leave her to that love of God
      which she has attained after so many tears; perhaps it would be prudent to
      spare her fresh shocks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no!" interrupted William, "I cannot give up, even to God, this last
      relic of my family, the sole prop of my old age. I will try every means to
      revive in her heart its early sentiments. Give me Christine for a few days
      only! Let me conduct her to the place of her birth, to the scenes where
      she loved. She is deaf to my entreaties, but she will obey an order from
      you; bid her return for a while beneath her father's roof! Should she
      still wish it, after this last attempt, I will restore her hither."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take her, my son," replied the superior; "I will bid her follow. If God
      has indeed spoken to her soul, no worldly voice will move her. If it be
      otherwise, may she return no more to the cloister, but be blessed wherever
      she goes! Adieu, my son; the peace of the Lord be with you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope revived in the heart of William Van Amberg; it seemed to him as if&mdash;the
      convent threshold once passed&mdash;Christine would revert to her former
      character&mdash;to her youth and love. He believed he was about to remove
      his beloved child for ever from these gloomy walls, and with painful
      impatience he awaited her coming. Soon a light step was heard in the
      corridor; William threw open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78c"
      id="Page_78c">[Pg 78]</a></span> door, Christine was there, and no grating
      now separated her from her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My beloved Christine!" exclaimed William; "at last, then, you are
      restored to me; at last I can press you to my heart! Come, we will return
      to our own country, and revisit the house where we all dwelt together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sister Martha-Mary was still paler than at her first interview with
      William. If any expression was discernible upon that calm countenance, it
      was one of sadness. She allowed herself to be taken by the hand and
      conducted to the convent gate; but when the gate was opened, and, passing
      into the open air, she encountered the broad daylight and the fresh
      breeze, she tottered and leaned for support against the wall. Just then
      the sun rent the clouds, and threw its golden beams on plain and mountain;
      the air was clear and transparent, and the flat and monotonous horizon
      acquired beauty from the burst of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, my daughter!" said William; "see how lovely is the earth! How soft
      is the air we breathe! How good it is to be free, and to move towards that
      immense horizon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear uncle!" replied the novice; "how beautiful are the heavens!
      See how the sun shines above our heads! It is in heaven that his glory
      should be admired! His rays are already dim and feeble when they touch the
      earth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79c" id="Page_79c">[Pg 79]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      William led Christine to a carriage; they got in, and the horses set off.
      Long did the gaze of the novice remain fixed on her convent's walls; when
      these were hidden from her by the windings of the road, she closed her
      eyes and seemed to sleep. During the journey, William endeavoured in vain
      to make her converse; she had forgotten how to express her thoughts. When
      compelled to reply, fatigue overwhelmed her; her whole existence was
      concentrated in her soul, and detached entirely from the external world.
      At intervals she would say to herself, "How long the morning is! Nothing
      marks the hours; I have not heard a single bell to-day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they reached the red house, and the carriage drove into the court,
      where the grass grew between the stones. Gothon came out to receive them,
      and Martha-Mary, leaning on her uncle's arm, entered the parlour where the
      family of Van Amberg had so often assembled. The room was deserted and
      cold; no books or work gave it the look of habitation; abandoned by its
      last occupants, it awaited new ones. Christine slowly traversed this
      well-known apartment, and sat down upon a chair near the window. It was
      there her mother had sat for twenty years; there had her childhood passed
      at the knees of Annunciata.
    </p>
    <p>
      William opened the window, showed her the meadow, the willows, and the
      river. Christine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80c" id="Page_80c">[Pg
      80]</a></span> looked at them in silence, her head resting on her hand,
      her eyes fixed on the horizon. For a long while William stood beside her,
      then he placed his hand on her shoulder and pronounced her name. She rose
      and followed him. They ascended the stairs, traversed the gallery, and
      William opened a door. "Your mother's room," said he to Christine. The
      novice entered and paused in the middle of the chamber; tears flowed from
      her eyes, she clasped her hands and prayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter," said William, "<i>she</i> ardently desired your happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has obtained it!" replied the novice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man felt a profound sadness come over him. It was like pressing to
      his heart a corpse to which his love restored neither breath nor warmth.
      Martha-Mary approached her mother's bed, knelt down, and kissed the pillow
      that had supported the dying head of Annunciata.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," she murmured, "soon we shall meet again."
    </p>
    <p>
      William shuddered. He took Christine's hand, and led her to the room she
      had formerly occupied. The little white-curtained bed was still there, the
      guitar hung against the wall, Christine's favourite volumes filled the
      shelves of her modest book-case; through the open window were seen the
      willows and the river. Martha-Mary noticed none of these things: the
      wooden crucifix was still upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81c"
      id="Page_81c">[Pg 81]</a></span> wall; she rapidly approached it, knelt,
      bowed her head upon the feet of Christ, closed her eyes and breathed
      deeply, like one finding repose after long fatigue. Like the exile
      returning to his native land, like the storm-tossed mariner regaining the
      port, she remained with her brow resting upon her Saviour's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing by her side, William looked on in tearful silence. Farther off,
      Gothon wiped her eyes with her apron. Several hours elapsed. The house
      clock struck, the birds sang in the garden; the wind rustled among the
      trees; in the lofty pigeon-house the doves cooed; the cock crowed in the
      poultry-yard. None of these loved and familiar sounds could divert
      Martha-Mary from her devout meditation. Sick at heart, her uncle descended
      to the parlour. He remained there long, plunged in gloomy reflections.
      Suddenly hasty steps were heard; a young man rushed into the room, and
      into William's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine! Christine!" cried Herbert; "where is Christine? Is it not a
      dream? M. Van Amberg gives me Christine!... Once more in my native land,
      and Christine mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Karl Van Amberg gives, but God refuses her to you!" replied William,
      mournfully. Then he told Herbert what had passed at the convent, and since
      their arrival at the house: he gave a thousand details&mdash;he repeated
      them a thousand times, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82c"
      id="Page_82c">[Pg 82]</a></span> without convincing Herbert of the
      melancholy truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is impossible!" cried the young man; "if Christine is alive, if
      Christine is here, to the first word uttered by her lover, Christine will
      reply."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God grant it!" exclaimed William; "my last hope is in you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert sprang up the stairs, his heart too full of love to have room for
      fear. Christine free, was for him Christine ready to become his wife. He
      hastily opened her chamber door; but then he paused, as if petrified, upon
      the threshold. The day was closing in, and its fading light fell upon
      Martha-Mary, whose form stood out like a white shadow from the gloom of
      the room. She was still on her knees, her head resting on the feet of
      Christ, her fragile person lost in the multiplied folds of her conventual
      robes. She heard not the opening of the door, and Herbert stood gazing at
      her, till a flood of tears burst from his eyes. William took his hand and
      silently pressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am frightened!" said Herbert, in a low tone. "That is not my Christine!
      A phantom risen from the earth, or an angel descended from heaven, has
      taken her place!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she is no longer Christine!" replied William, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments more Herbert stood in mournful<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_83c" id="Page_83c">[Pg 83]</a></span> contemplation. Then he
      exclaimed&mdash;"Christine, dear Christine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of his voice the novice started, rose to her feet, and
      pronounced his name. As in former days, when her lover called "Christine!"
      Martha-Mary replied "Herbert!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man's heart beat violently; he stood beside the novice, he took
      her hands. "It is I, it is Herbert!" he said, kneeling down before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The novice fixed her large black eyes upon him with a long inquiring gaze;
      a slight flush passed across her brow; then she became pale as before, and
      said gently to Herbert&mdash;"I thought not to see you again upon earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Christine! tears and suffering have long been our portion; but happy
      days at last dawn upon us! My love! my bride! we will never part again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha-Mary extricated her hands from those of Herbert, and retreated
      towards the image of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the bride of the Lord," she said in trembling accents. "He expects
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert uttered a cry of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine! dear Christine! remember our oft-repeated pledges, our loves,
      our tears, our hopes. You left me vowing to love me always. Christine, if
      you would not have me die of despair, remember the past!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84c" id="Page_84c">[Pg 84]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha-Mary's eyes continued riveted on the crucifix; her hands,
      convulsively clasped, were extended towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious Lord!" she prayed, "speak to his heart as you have spoken to
      mine! It is a noble heart, worthy to love you. Stronger than I, Herbert
      may survive, even after much weeping! Console him, oh Lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine! my first and only love! sole hope and joy of my life! do you
      thus abandon me? That heart, once entirely mine, is it closed to me for
      ever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gaze upon the crucifix, her hands still joined, the novice, as if able
      to speak only to her God, gently replied:&mdash;"Lord! he suffers as I
      suffered! shed upon him the balm wherewith you healed my wounds! Leaving
      him life, take his soul as you have taken mine. Give him that ineffable
      peace which descends upon those thou lovest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh Christine! my beloved!" cried Herbert, once more taking her hand, "do
      but look at me! turn your eyes upon me and behold my tears! Dearest
      treasure of my heart! you seem to slumber! Awake! Have you forgotten our
      tender meetings, the willows bending over the stream, the boat in which we
      sailed a whole night, dreaming the joy of eternal union? See! the moon
      rises as it rose that night. We were near each other as now; but then they
      tore us asunder, and now we are free to be<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_85c" id="Page_85c">[Pg 85]</a></span> together! Christine, have
      you ceased to love? Is all forgotten?"
    </p>
    <p>
      William took her other hand. "Dear child," he said, "we entreat you not to
      leave us! To you we look for happiness; remain with us, Christine."
    </p>
    <p>
      One hand in the hands of Herbert, the other in those of William, the
      novice slowly and solemnly replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The corpse that reposes in the tomb lifts not the stone to re-enter the
      world. The soul that has seen heaven, does not leave it to return to
      earth. The creature to whom God has said, 'Be thou the spouse of Christ,'
      does not quit Christ to unite herself to a man; and she who is about to
      die should turn her affections from mortal things!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert!" cried William, "be silent! Not another word! I can scarcely
      feel the throbbing of her pulse! She is paler even than when I first saw
      her behind the convent grating. We give her pain. Enough, Herbert, enough!
      Better yield her to God upon earth, than send her to Him in heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man placed the almost inanimate head of Martha-Mary upon his
      shoulder, and pressed her to his heart as a mother embraces her child.
      "Recover yourself, my daughter," he said; "I will restore you to the house
      of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha-Mary turned her sad and gentle gaze upon her uncle, and her hand
      feebly pressed his. Then addressing herself to Herbert:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86c" id="Page_86c">[Pg 86]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, Herbert," she said, in a scarcely audible voice&mdash;"you, who will
      live, do not abandon him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christine!" cried Herbert, on his knees before his betrothed. "Christine!
      do we part for ever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The novice raised her eyes to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for ever!" she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some days afterwards the convent gates opened to receive sister
      Martha-Mary. They closed upon her for the last time. With feeble and
      unsteady step the novice traversed the cloisters to prostrate herself on
      the altar-steps. The superior came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh my mother!" exclaimed Christine, the fountain of whose tears was
      opened, and who wept as in the days of her childhood, "I have seen him and
      left him! To thee I return, oh Lord! Faithful to my vows, I await the
      crown that shall consecrate me thy spouse. Thy voice alone shall
      henceforward reach my ears; I come to sing thy praises, to pray and serve
      thee until the end of my life!&mdash;Holy mother, prepare the robe of
      serge, the white crown, the silver cross; I am ready!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter," replied the superior, "you are very ill&mdash;much
      exhausted by so many shocks; will you not delay the ceremony of
      profession?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, holy mother! no; delay it not! I would die the bride of the Lord!...
      And I have little time!" replied sister Martha-Mary.

    <p class="dropcap">
      In my younger days, bell-ringing was much more in fashion among the young
      men of &mdash;&mdash; than it is now. Nobody, I believe, practises it
      there at present except the servants of the church, and the melody has
      been much injured in consequence. Some fifty years ago, about twenty of us
      who dwelt in the vicinity of the Cathedral, formed a club, which used to
      ring every peal that was called for; and, from continual practice and a
      rivalry which arose between us and a club attached to another steeple, and
      which tended considerably to sharpen our zeal, we became very Mozarts on
      our favourite instruments. But my bell-ringing practice was shortened by a
      singular accident, which not only stopped my performance, but made even
      the sound of a bell terrible to my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday, I went with another into the belfry to ring for noon prayers,
      but the second stroke we had pulled showed us that the clapper of the bell<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88c" id="Page_88c">[Pg 88]</a></span> we
      were at was muffled. Some one had been buried that morning, and it had
      been prepared, of course, to ring a mournful note. We did not know of
      this, but the remedy was easy. "Jack," said my companion, "step up to the
      loft, and cut off the hat;" for the way we had of muffling was by tying a
      piece of an old hat, or of cloth (the former was preferred), to one side
      of the clapper, which deadened every second toll. I complied, and mounting
      into the belfry, crept as usual into the bell, where I began to cut away.
      The hat had been tied on in some more complicated manner than usual, and I
      was perhaps three or four minutes in getting it off; during which time my
      companion below was hastily called away&mdash;by a message from his
      sweetheart, I believe&mdash;but that is not material to my story. The
      person who called him was a brother of the club, who, knowing that the
      time had come for ringing for service, and not thinking that any one was
      above, began to pull. At this moment I was just getting out, when I felt
      the bell moving; I guessed the reason at once&mdash;it was a moment of
      terror; but by a hasty and almost convulsive effort, I succeeded in
      jumping down, and throwing myself on the flat of my back under the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room in which it was, was little more than sufficient to contain it,
      the bottom of the bell coming within a couple of feet of the floor of
      lath. At that time I certainly was not so bulky as I am now,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89c" id="Page_89c">[Pg 89]</a></span> but as
      I lay it was within an inch of my face. I had not laid myself down a
      second, when the ringing began.&mdash;It was a dreadful situation. Over me
      swung an immense mass of metal, one touch of which would have crushed me
      to pieces; the floor under me was principally composed of crazy laths, and
      if they gave way, I was precipitated to the distance of about fifty feet
      upon a loft, which would, in all probability, have sunk under the impulse
      of my fall, and sent me to be dashed to atoms upon the marble floor of the
      chancel, an hundred feet below. I remembered&mdash;for fear is quick in
      recollection&mdash;how a common clockwright, about a month before, had
      fallen, and, bursting through the floors of the steeple, driven in the
      ceilings of the porch, and even broken into the marble tombstone of a
      bishop who slept beneath. This was my first terror, but the ringing had
      not continued a minute, before a more awful and immediate dread came on
      me. The deafening sound of the bell smote into my ears with a thunder
      which made me fear their drums would crack: there was not a fibre of my
      body it did not thrill through. It entered my very soul; thought and
      reflection were almost utterly banished; I only retained the sensation of
      agonising terror. Every moment I saw the bell sweep within an inch of my
      face; and my eyes&mdash;I could not close them, though to look at the
      object was bitter as death&mdash;followed it instinctively in its<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90c" id="Page_90c">[Pg 90]</a></span>
      oscillating progress until it came back again. It was in vain I said to
      myself that it could come no nearer at any future swing than it did at
      first; every time it descended, I endeavoured to shrink into the very
      floor to avoid being buried under the down-sweeping mass; and then,
      reflecting on the danger of pressing too weightily on my frail support,
      would cower up again as far as I dared.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first my fears were mere matter of fact. I was afraid the pulleys above
      would give way, and let the bell plunge on me. At another time, the
      possibility of the clapper being shot out in some sweep, and dashing
      through my body, as I had seen a ramrod glide through a door, flitted
      across my mind. The dread also, as I have already mentioned, of the crazy
      floor, tormented me; but these soon gave way to fears not more unfounded,
      but more visionary, and of course more tremendous. The roaring of the bell
      confused my intellect, and my fancy soon began to teem with all sort of
      strange and terrifying ideas. The bell pealing above, and opening its jaws
      with a hideous clamour, seemed to me at one time a ravening monster,
      raging to devour me; at another, a whirlpool ready to suck me into its
      bellowing abyss. As I gazed on it, it assumed all shapes; it was a flying
      eagle, or rather a roc of the Arabian story-tellers, clapping its wings
      and screaming over me. As I looked upward into it, it would appear
      sometimes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91c" id="Page_91c">[Pg 91]</a></span>
      lengthen into indefinite extent, or to be twisted at the end into the
      spiral folds of the tail of a flying dragon. Nor was the flaming breath or
      fiery glance of that fabled animal wanting to complete the picture. My
      eyes, inflamed, blood-shot, and glaring, invested the supposed monster
      with a full proportion of unholy light.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be endless were I to merely hint at all the fancies that
      possessed my mind. Every object that was hideous and roaring presented
      itself to my imagination. I often thought that I was in a hurricane at
      sea, and that the vessel in which I was embarked tossed under me with the
      most furious vehemence. The air, set in motion by the swinging of the
      bell, blew over me, nearly with the violence, and more than the thunder,
      of a tempest; and the floor seemed to reel under me, as under a drunken
      man. But the most awful of all the ideas that seized on me were drawn from
      the supernatural. In the vast cavern of the bell hideous faces appeared,
      and glared down on me with terrifying frowns, or with grinning mockery
      still more appalling. At last, the devil himself, accoutred as in the
      common description of the evil spirit, with hoof, horn, and tail, and eyes
      of infernal lustre, made his appearance, and called on me to curse God and
      worship him, who was powerful to save me. This dread suggestion he uttered
      with the full-toned clangour of the bell. I had him within<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92c" id="Page_92c">[Pg 92]</a></span> an
      inch of me, and I thought on the fate of the Santon Barsisa. Strenuously
      and desperately I defied him and bade him begone. Reason, then, for a
      moment, resumed her sway, but it was only to fill me with fresh terror,
      just as the lightning dispels the gloom that surrounds the benighted
      mariner, but to show him that his vessel is driving on a rock, where she
      must inevitably be dashed to pieces. I found I was becoming delirious, and
      trembled lest reason should utterly desert me. This is at all times an
      agonising thought, but it smote me then with tenfold agony. I feared lest,
      when utterly deprived of my senses, I should rise&mdash;to do which I was
      every moment tempted by that strange feeling which calls on a man, whose
      head is dizzy from standing on the battlement of a lofty castle, to
      precipitate himself from it, and then death would be instant and
      tremendous. When I thought of this, I became desperate. I caught the floor
      with a grasp which drove the blood from my nails; and I yelled with the
      cry of despair. I called for help, I prayed, I shouted, but all the
      efforts of my voice were of course drowned in the bell. As it passed over
      my mouth, it occasionally echoed my cries, which mixed not with its own
      sound, but preserved their distinct character. Perhaps this was but fancy.
      To me, I know, they then sounded as if they were the shouting, howling, or
      laughing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93c" id="Page_93c">[Pg
      93]</a></span> fiends with which my imagination had peopled the gloomy
      cave which swung over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may accuse me of exaggerating my feelings; but I am not. Many a scene
      of dread have I since passed through, but they are nothing to the
      self-inflicted terrors of this half hour. The ancients have doomed one of
      the damned, in their Tartarus, to lie under a rock, which every moment
      seems to be descending to annihilate him&mdash;and an awful punishment it
      would be. But if to this you add a clamour as loud as if ten thousand
      furies were howling about you&mdash;a deafening uproar banishing reason,
      and driving you to madness&mdash;you must allow that the bitterness of the
      pang was rendered more terrible. There is no man, firm as his nerves may
      be, who could retain his courage in this situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In twenty minutes the ringing was done. Half of that time passed over me
      without power of computation,&mdash;the other half appeared an age. When
      it ceased, I became gradually more quiet, but a new fear retained me. I
      knew that five minutes would elapse without ringing, but, at the end of
      that short time, the bell would be rung a second time, for five minutes
      more. I could not calculate time. A minute and an hour were of equal
      duration. I feared to rise, lest the five minutes should have elapsed, and
      the ringing be again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94c" id="Page_94c">[Pg
      94]</a></span> commenced, in which case I should be crushed, before I
      could escape, against the walls or framework of the bell. I therefore
      still continued to lie down, cautiously shifting myself, however, with a
      careful gliding, so that my eye no longer looked into the hollow. This was
      of itself a considerable relief. The cessation of the noise had, in a
      great measure, the effect of stupifying me, for my attention, being no
      longer occupied by the chimeras I had conjured up, began to flag. All that
      now distressed me was the constant expectation of the second ringing, for
      which, however, I settled myself with a kind of stupid resolution. I
      closed my eyes, and clenched my teeth as firmly as if they were screwed in
      a vice. At last the dreaded moment came, and the first swing of the bell
      extorted a groan from me, as they say the most resolute victim screams at
      the sight of the rack, to which he is for a second time destined. After
      this, however, I lay silent and lethargic, without a thought. Wrapt in the
      defensive armour of stupidity, I defied the bell and its intonations. When
      it ceased, I was roused a little by the hope of escape. I did not,
      however, decide on this step hastily, but, putting up my hand with the
      utmost caution, I touched the rim. Though the ringing had ceased, it still
      was tremulous from the sound, and shook under my hand, which instantly
      recoiled as from an electric jar. A quarter of an hour probably<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95c" id="Page_95c">[Pg 95]</a></span>
      elapsed before I again dared to make the experiment, and then I found it
      at rest. I determined to lose no time, fearing that I might have lain then
      already too long, and that the bell for evening service would catch me.
      This dread stimulated me, and I slipped out with the utmost rapidity, and
      arose. I stood, I suppose, for a minute, looking with silly wonder on the
      place of my imprisonment, penetrated with joy at escaping, but then rushed
      down the stony and irregular stair with the velocity of lightning, and
      arrived in the bell-ringers' room. This was the last act I had power to
      accomplish. I leant against the wall, motionless and deprived of thought,
      in which posture my companions found me, when, in the course of a couple
      of hours, they returned to their occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were shocked, as well they might, at the figure before them. The wind
      of the bell had excoriated my face, and my dim and stupified eyes were
      fixed with a lack-lustre gaze in my raw eyelids. My hands were torn and
      bleeding; my hair dishevelled; and my clothes tattered. They spoke to me,
      but I gave no answer. They shook me, but I remained insensible. They then
      became alarmed, and hastened to remove me. He who had first gone up with
      me in the forenoon, met them as they carried me through the churchyard,
      and through him, who was shocked at having, in some measure,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96c" id="Page_96c">[Pg 96]</a></span>
      occasioned the accident, the cause of my misfortune was discovered. I was
      put to bed at home, and remained for three days delirious, but gradually
      recovered my senses. You may be sure the bell formed a prominent topic of
      my ravings, and if I heard a peal, they were instantly increased to the
      utmost violence. Even when the delirium abated, my sleep was continually
      disturbed by imagined ringings, and my dreams were haunted by the fancies
      which almost maddened me while in the steeple. My friends removed me to a
      house in the country, which was sufficiently distant from any place of
      worship, to save me from the apprehensions of hearing the church-going
      bell; for what Alexander Selkirk, in Cowper's poem, complained of as a
      misfortune, was then to me as a blessing. Here I recovered; but, even long
      after recovery, if a gale wafted the notes of a peal towards me, I started
      with nervous apprehension. I felt a Mohammedan hatred to all the bell
      tribe, and envied the subjects of the Commander of the Faithful the
      sonorous voice of their Muezzin. Time cured this, as it does the most of
      our follies; but even at the present day, if, by chance, my nerves be
      unstrung, some particular tones of the cathedral bell have power to
      surprise me into a momentary start.
